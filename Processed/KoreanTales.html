<p class="first">The national emblem of Korea, pictured on the cover,
represents the male and female elements of nature; the dark blue
representing Heaven (the male), the yellow representing Earth (the
female). As seen across the Eastern Sea, the heavens seem to lap over
and embrace the earth, while the earth, to landwards, rises in the
lofty mountains and folds the heavens in its embrace, making a
harmonious whole.</p>
<p>The characters represent the four points of the compass, and belong
to the original eight characters given by the first King, and from
which &ldquo;all language&rdquo; sprung. The whole set is as

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Repeatedly, since returning to the United States,
people have asked me, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write a book on
Korea?&rdquo; I have invariably replied that it was not necessary, and
referred the inquirers to the large work of Dr. Griffis, entitled
&ldquo;Corea, the Hermit Kingdom,&rdquo; which covers the subject in a
charming manner.</p>
<p>My object in writing this book was to correct the erroneous
impressions I have found somewhat prevalent&mdash;that the Koreans were
a semi-savage people. And believing that the object could be
accomplished best in displaying the thought, life, and habits of the
people as portrayed in their native lore, I have made these
translations, which, while they are so chosen as to cover various
phases of life, are not to be considered as especially selected.</p>
<p>I also wished to have some means of answering the constant inquiries
from all parts of the country concerning Korean life and
characteristics.</p>
<p>People in Washington have asked me if Korea was an island in the
Mediterranean; others <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4"
name="pb4">4</a>]</span>have asked if Korea could be reached by rail
from Europe; others have supposed that Korea was somewhere in the South
Seas, with a climate that enabled the natives to dispense with
clothing. I have therefore included two chapters, introductory and
descriptive in character, concerning the subjects of the majority of
such questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Globe trotters,&rdquo; in passing from Japan to North China,
usually go by way of the Korean ports, now that a line of excellent
Japanese steamships covers that route. These travellers see the
somewhat barren coasts of Korea&mdash;left so, that outsiders might not
be tempted to come to the then hermit country; perhaps they land at
Chemulpoo (the port of the capital, thirty miles distant), and stroll
through the rows of miserable, temporary huts, occupied by the
stevedores, the pack-coolies, chair-bearers, and other transient scum,
and then write a long article descriptive of Korea. As well might they
describe America as seen among the slab shanties of one of the newest
western railroad towns, for when the treaties were formed in 1882 not a
house stood where Chemulpoo now stands, with its several thousand
regular inhabitants and as many more transients.</p>

<p class="first">Korea, Corea, or Chosen (morning calm) occupies the
peninsula hanging down from Manchooria and Russian Siberia between
China and Japan, and extending from the 33d to the 43d parallels of
north latitude.</p>
<p>The area, including the outlying islands, is about one hundred
thousand square miles. The population, according to the most reliable
estimate, is a little more than sixteen millions. Yet, as the people
live in cities, towns, and hamlets, the country does not seem to be
thickly settled.</p>
<p>The climate varies much at the extremities of the peninsula, owing
to the fact that the southern portion is somewhat affected by the warm
southern currents that give Japan its tropical climate, but which are
warded off from Korea proper by the Japanese islands. The climate of
the central and northern provinces is much the same as that of the
northern central United States, with fewer changes. The large river at
the capital is not uncommonly frozen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6"
href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>over for weeks at a time during the
winter, so that heavy carts pass over on the ice. Ice is always
preserved for general use in summer.</p>
<p>The country is decidedly mountainous, and well watered. Heavy timber
abounds in the northeast. The valleys are very fertile and are well
tilled, as the people are mainly devoted to agriculture.</p>
<p>The mineral resources have only been developed in a crude way, yet
sufficiently to demonstrate the great wealth of the ore deposits.
Especially is this true in reference to the gold mines.</p>
<p>The most pessimistic visitors to Korea are unstinted in their praise
of the beautiful scenery, which is fully appreciated by the natives as
well. From ancient times they have had guide-books setting forth the
natural charms of particular localities; and excursions to distant
places for the sole purpose of enjoying the views are a common
occurrence.</p>
<p>The King rules as absolute monarch. He is assisted by the
Prime-Minister and his two associates&mdash;the ministers of the Left
and Right. Next to these come the heads of the six departments of
Etiquette and Ceremonies, Finance, War, Public Works, Justice, and
Registration, with the heads of the two new departments that have been
added as the result of the opening <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7"
href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>up of foreign intercourse&mdash;the
Foreign (or outside) Office, and the Home (or interior) Office. This
body of officials forms the grand council of the King.</p>
<p>Each of the eight provinces is ruled by a governor, who has under
him prefects, local magistrates, supervisors of hamlets, and petty
officials, so that the whole scale makes a very complete system and
affords no lack of officials.</p>
<p>There are several special officers appointed by the King, one of
whom is the government inspector, whose duty it is to go about in
disguise, learn the condition of the people, and ascertain if any
magistrate abuses his office and oppresses the people unjustly. Any
such he may bring to speedy justice.</p>
<p>The present Dynasty has existed 498 years. Being founded by a
revolting general named Ye, it is known as the Ye Dynasty. The
King&rsquo;s name, however, is never used. He is almost sacred to his
people. Those officials of sufficiently high rank to go in before him
bow to the ground in his presence, and only speak when spoken to; then
they use a highly <span class="corr" id="xd25e329" title=
"Source: honoriffic">honorific</span> language only understood at
court.</p>
<p>The revenues are paid in kind, hence the annual income of an
official may consist of a certain quantity of rice, and other products,
in addition to his money compensation. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>King, also,
has the whole revenue resulting from the sale of the ginseng, for which
the country is noted. This forms his private purse.</p>
<p>The currency is the common copper cash, worth some twelve hundred to
the Mexican dollar; though now that the new mint is in operation,
copper, silver, and gold coins are being made. The old perforated cash
will, however, be hard to supplant, owing to its convenience in small
transactions.</p>
<p>Banks proper do not exist; though the government does a kind of
banking business in granting orders on various provincial offices, so
that a travelling official need not be burdened with much ready money.
A number of large brokers at the capital assist in the government
financial transactions.</p>
<p>All unoccupied land belongs to the King, but any man may take up a
homestead, and, after tilling it and paying taxes on it for a period of
three years, it becomes his own, and must be purchased should the
government need it.</p>
<p>Deeds are given in the form of receipts and quit-claims by the
seller. These may be registered with the local magistrate. Wills, as
understood in western countries, are not executed; though a father
wishing to provide especially for the children of his concubines may
make a will, or statement, the proper execution of which devolves upon
the eldest son. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>Records of the births of males are kept, as are also records of
deaths, but these are not always reliable. All males of fifteen years
of age are registered at the Hang Sung Poo, or Department of
Registration, which issues to them tablets bearing their name and
address. Children are also generally provided with these tablets, to
prevent their getting lost.</p>
<p>The people are well built and strong, as a rule. They are a loyal,
contented race, not grasping, and rather too easy in disposition. They
are intelligent and learn with great ease. Possessed of many
characteristics in common with their neighbors, the Chinese and
Japanese, they yet seem to have a personality indicative of a different
parentage, which continually calls forth inquiry as to their origin. In
some slight degree they resemble the aborigines of America, and it is
believed that their ancestors came from the north:&mdash;the question
opens up a fertile field for study. Their written records are said to
date back three thousand years. Their traditional first king descended
from heaven five thousand years ago. With a civilization of such age
they might well be excused for so long barring their doors against the
new civilization of the young nations of the West. While, as a matter
of fact, the difference existing between the two is more one of degree
than essence, perhaps more vices may be found in the civilization
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>of the West than are known to this people. And,
with a few exceptions, the virtues taught by the modern civilization
have been practised for centuries behind the bars of isolation that
shut in this self-satisfied people.</p>
<p>The people dress in imported cotton sheetings mostly, padding them
well with cotton-wool for winter use, and using the plain bleached
white, or dying the cloth a light shade of blue or green. Rice is the
staple article of food in the central and southern provinces; wheat
enters more largely into the diet of the northern people. Their cattle
are as large and fine as may be found anywhere; the people eat much
beef, and hides are a prominent article of export. Their houses are
well built and comfortable; foreigners adapt them to their own use with
little trouble. The houses are heated by means of a system of flues
underneath the floor, which is made of large flagstone placed over the
flues and well cemented; over all thick, strong, oil paper is placed,
making a rich, dark, highly polished floor, through which no smoke can
come, though it is always agreeably warm. The houses are all one story,
built around a court, and several sets of buildings, each within a
separate wall, usually make up a gentleman&rsquo;s compound. The
buildings are covered with a thick layer of earth and capped with tile
laid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>on in graceful curves. This roof insures coolness
in summer. The rooms are made almost air-tight by the plentiful use of
paper on the walls outside and in, as well as for doors and
windows.</p>
<p>There are three great classes in Korea: the nobility, the middle
class, and the commoners. A commoner, not of the proscribed orders, may
rise to nobility by successfully passing the competitive examinations.
The officials are appointed from the noble classes.</p>
<p>The language is peculiar to the country, and while written official
documents are done in the common character of China and Japan, the
spoken language of neither of these people is understood in Korea. The
native language of Korea possesses an alphabet and grammar, and is
polysyllabic, thus resembling English more than it does Chinese.</p>
<p>In religious matters the Koreans are peculiar in that they may be
said to be without a religion, properly speaking. Prior to the advent
of the present dynasty, Buddhism reigned, but for 498 years it has been
in such disfavor that no priest dare enter a walled city. They still
maintain temples in the mountains, but exert but little if any
influence. In morals the people are <span class="corr" id="xd25e362"
title="Source: Confucionists">Confucianists</span>, and their reverent
devotion to their ancestors may serve in part as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>religion. In times of distress they &ldquo;pray to
Heaven,&rdquo; and seem really to be very devoutly inclined.</p>
<p>Christianity came into disfavor through the indiscretion of its
early teachers. The distrust is slowly passing away now, and
missionaries are openly employed in doing the educational work that
must precede any successful attempt to secure the adoption of beliefs
so radically different from all existing ideas.</p>
<p>Some of the results of the outside intercourse that has been
indulged in for the past eight years may be mentioned. A maritime
customs service, under the charge of American and European officers, is
in very successful operation. So is a hospital, supported by the
government and operated by American physicians, gratuitously furnished
by the American Presbyterian Mission. The government supports a school
for which American teachers are employed. American military officers
have charge of the reorganization of the army and conduct a school for
the purpose of instructing the young officers. A mint, machine-shops,
powder-mills, silk filatures, an electric light, and a telegraph and
cable line are some of the new institutions recently adopted and, as a
rule, now in successful operation. Steamships have also been purchased
more for the purpose of transporting tribute rice than as a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>nucleus for a navy. In regard to the relations
existing between Korea and China the reader is respectfully referred to
a paper delivered before the American Oriental Society by the Chinese
scholar, W. W. Rockhill, U. S. Secretary of Legation at Pekin, and
contained in Vol. III. of the Society&rsquo;s publications for 1888. In
his preface Mr. Rockhill says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nature of Korea&rsquo;s relations with China has for the
last thirty years been a puzzle for Western nations. Were
they&mdash;with the ambiguous utterance of the Chinese Government
before them that &lsquo;Korea, though a vassal and tributary state of
China, was entirely independent so far as her government, religion, and
intercourse with foreign States were concerned&rsquo;&mdash;to consider
it as an integral part of the Chinese Empire, or should they treat it
as a sovereign state, enjoying absolute international rights?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The problem was practically solved by the conclusion of the
treaty between Japan, and later on the United States, and Korea, but
this has not materially altered the nature of the relations existing
for the last four centuries, at least between China and its so-called
vassal. That China has, however, derived profit from the opening of
Korea to the commerce of nations, there can be no doubt, for she, too,
being at liberty to conclude treaties with Korea <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>and open
this new market to her merchants, has done so, like other nations,
though she has chosen to call her treaty by the euphonious name of
&lsquo;commercial and trade regulations for the subjects of China and
Korea&rsquo;, and her diplomatic representative in <span class="corr"
id="xd25e380" title="Source: S&ouml;ul">Seoul</span>, &lsquo;Minister
Resident for political and commercial affairs.&rsquo; What
China&rsquo;s relations with Korea were prior to the opening of the
latter kingdom by the treaty of 1883, I propose to show in the
following pages, taking as my authorities official Chinese publications
and writings of men in official position.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="super">KOREAN TALES.</h2>
<h2 class="main">DESCRIPTIVE.</h2>
<h2 class="main">SEOUL&mdash;THE CAPITAL.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As &ldquo;Paris is France,&rdquo; so Seoul may be said
to be Korea, for it is the centre from which nearly every thing for the
country either originates or is disseminated. Officers ruling over
country districts usually have their &ldquo;house in town,&rdquo; and
expect to spend a portion, at least, of their time within the walls of
the capital. While some of the provincial capitals are said to contain
more people and to be more celebrated for certain reasons, Seoul is the
home of the King and the Mecca of his faithful subjects. A description
of this city may, therefore, answer for all. The capital is a city of
some 300,000 inhabitants, half of whom, perhaps, live in the extensive
suburbs without the walls. It lies in a basin of granite sand,
surrounded by high mountains <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>and their projecting ridges, over
which climbs the high, thick, encircling wall of masonry; pierced at
convenient points by massive, pagoda-roofed gates, amply strong enough
for defense against the weapons of war in use at the time of building
this great relic of seclusion.</p>
<p>The city is traversed by broad avenues from which runs a perfect
labyrinth of narrow streets. Originally none of these streets were less
than twenty feet wide, and some of the avenues leading up to the
imposing gates of the palaces are even now a good two hundred feet in
width. But the streets have all been encroached upon by the little
temporary thatched booths of the petty retail dealers, so that, with
the exception of the approaches to the palaces, the line is broken, the
streets made tortuous, and only here and there a broad open spot
indicates the original width of the thoroughfare. Originally every
street was furnished with its sewer&mdash;open in the smaller streets,
while the avenues were drained by great covered sewers of stonework.
Occasionally the proprietor of one of the little temporary booths would
put a foundation under his structure, bridging over the sewer, until
now the streets have in many cases become mere crooked alleys, and but
for the bountiful rains, the excellent natural drainage, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>and the
character of the soil, the mortality would be very great instead of
being less than in ordinary American cities. No attempt is made towards
street decoration, as that would attract the attention of thieves. The
magnificent grounds of a nobleman, with their artificial lakes, flower
gardens, water-worn pillars of ancient rock and quaintly twisted trees,
may be enclosed by a row of tumble-down, smoke-begrimed
servant-quarters that would never indicate the beauty to be found
hidden within its forbidding exterior.</p>
<p>Travellers never seem to realize that a street in the East is apt to
be but a &ldquo;way&rdquo; between two points, and as the usual
Oriental odors greet their nostrils and their eyes rest on the dirty
servants and their dirtier hovels, they at once denounce the whole
town.</p>
<p>There is attraction enough, however, in a Korean street for any one
who is in search of strange sights. Looking down one of the broad
thoroughfares of Seoul from a point on the city wall, the sun&rsquo;s
rays, falling on the light-colored gowns of the pedestrians as they
saunter along amid the bulls and ponies, produce a kaleidoscopic effect
that is certainly charming. Passing down into the throng it will be
seen to be made up mostly of men, with here and there a group of common
women, each closely veiled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>with a bright green gown, made like
the long outer garment of the men, and possessing little sleeves of
crimson. This strange garment is never worn, but is always used as a
covering for the fair (?) face. Tradition teaches that in ancient
times, when wars were frequent, veils were discarded and these gowns
were worn by the wives and sisters, that, in case of sudden call to
arms, they could be given to their husbands and brothers to be worn to
battle&mdash;hence the red sleeves, upon which the gory sword was to be
wiped.</p>
<p>The peculiar gauze &ldquo;stove-pipe&rdquo; hat of the men, about
which so much has been said, also has its origin in tradition, as
follows: In ancient days conspiracies were common; to prevent these an
edict was issued compelling all men to wear great earthenware hats, the
size of an umbrella (type of the mourner&rsquo;s hat in Korea to-day,
except that the latter is made of finely woven basket-work). This law
became very odious, for in addition to the weight of the hats, not more
than a very few men could come close enough together to converse, and
even then spies could hear their necessarily loud whispering. Little by
little, therefore, the law began to be infringed upon till the people
got down to the present airy structure of horsehair, silk, and bamboo.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another story is, that petty wars being too frequent between rival
sections, all men were compelled to wear these umbrella hats of clay.
In case one became broken the possessor was punished by
decapitation&mdash;naturally they stopped their fighting and took good
care of their hats till the law was repealed.</p>
<p>The custom of wearing white so extensively as they do is also
accounted for by tradition. Mourning is a serious business in Korea,
for on the death of a father the son must lay aside his gay robes and
clothe himself in unbleached cotton of a very coarse texture. He wraps
his waist with a rope girdle, and puts on the umbrella hat, which
conceals the whole upper portion of his person. For further protection
against intrusion he carries a white fan, and, should he smoke, his
pipe must be wrapped with white. For three years he must wear this
guise and must do no work, so that the resources of even a large and
prosperous family may be thus exhausted.</p>
<p>Should a king die, the whole nation would be compelled to don this
mourning garb, or rather they would be compelled to dress in
white&mdash;the mourning color. Once, during a period of ten years,
three kings died, necessitating a constant change of dress on the part
of the people and a great outlay of money, for a Korean <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>wardrobe
is extensive and costly. Tradition has it, therefore, that, to be ready
for the caprice of their kings in the future, the people adopted white
as the national color.</p>
<p>The nobility and wealthy persons who can afford it, dress in rich
gayly colored silks, and even the common people add a little blue or
green to their outside robes, so that when they wander about over the
beautiful green hills in their favorite pastime of admiring the natural
beauties of a remarkably beautiful and well preserved landscape, their
bright gowns but add to the general effect. And a long procession of
monks emerging from their high mountain temple and descending along the
green mountain path might be taken for a company of the spirits with
which their literature abounds; especially will this be the case if, as
is common, the region of the temple is shrouded with clouds.</p>
<p>But little of home life is seen along the streets, and the favored
ones who may pass the great gates and traverse the many courts which
lead to the fine inclosures of the nobility would see but little of
home life, as the women have quarters by themselves, and are only seen
by the men of their own family.</p>
<p>It is pleasant, however, to see the little groups of the working
class sitting around the fire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href=
"#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>which is cooking their evening meal
and at the same time heating the platform of paper and cement-covered
stones which form the floor of their bed chamber, and on which they
will spread their mats and sleep. They will all be found to be smoking,
and if tobacco was ever a blessing to any people it is to the lower
classes in Korea, who find in it their greatest comfort. No one could
see the solid enjoyment taken by a Korean coolie with his pipe without
blessing the weed.</p>
<p>As the fires burn low, and one by one the smokers have knocked the
ashes from their pipes and sought the warm stone floor, a deep
stillness settles over the profoundly dark city. The rich, deep notes
of a great centrally located bell ring out as the watchman draws back a
huge suspended beam of wood, and releasing it, lets it strike the
bronze side of the heavy bell, from which vibration after vibration is
sent forth upon the still night-air.</p>
<p>Some weird music, which has been likened to that of Scotch bagpipes,
is heard from the direction of the city gates, and the traveller, who
is still threading the streets to his abode, feels thankful that he has
arrived in time, for now the massive gates are closed, and none may
enter without royal permission. The street traveller will also hasten
to his home or stopping-place, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>for between the ringing of the
evening chimes and the tolling of the bell to announce the approach of
dawn, all men must absent themselves from the streets, which then are
taken possession of by the women, who even then, as they flit about
from house to house with their little paper lanterns, go veiled lest
some passing official should see their faces.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e431src" href="#xd25e431" name="xd25e431src">1</a></p>
<p>The midnight stillness is broken by the barking of countless dogs,
but as cats are in disfavor their serenades are seldom heard. Another
sound is often, in busy times heard throughout the whole night. It is
peculiar to Korea, and to one who has lived long in the country it
means much. It is the drumming of the Korean laundry. To give the
light-colored gowns their highly prized lustre they must be well
pounded; for this purpose the cloth is wrapped around a long hard
roller which is fixed in a low frame, two women then sit facing each
other with, in each hand, a round, hard stick, something like a small
base-ball bat, and they commence beating the cloth, alternating so as
to make quite a musical tinkle.</p>
<p>Heard at some distance this rhythmic rattle is not unpleasant, and
one is assured that in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span>the deep night that has settled so like a
pall over the city, two persons are wide-awake and industriously
engaged, while, when the tapping ceases for a bit, one is comforted
with the thought that the poor things are enjoying a rich bit of
gossip, or welcoming a friend who is more fortunate in having finished
her ironing in time to enjoy the freedom of the night.</p>
<p>Inside the Palace the night is turned into day as nearly as can be
done by the electric light. The business of the government is mostly
transacted at night that the wheels of administration may run smoothly
during the day. At sun-down several lights may be seen on the summit of
the beautiful ever green south mountain which forms the southern limit
of the city; as does a grim stony peak on the north serve a similar
purpose on that side. The south mountain faces the Palaces. It also
commands a good view of the outlying peaks, upon some of which,
situated in suitable localities, are stationed watchmen, so placed as
to command a view of others farther and farther removed; thus forming
lines from the distant borders of the country to the capital. On these
peaks small signal-fires are nightly kindled, and as the lights are
seen by the watchman on the south mountain, he builds the proper number
of fires upon little altars in full view of the Palace. Then a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>body of gray old officers go in before His
Majesty, and bowing their heads to the floor, make known the verdict of
the signal-fires, as to whether peace reigns in the borders or not.
Soon after this the officials assemble and the business of the
government begins, the King giving his personal attention to all
matters of importance.</p>
<p>There are three palace inclosures in the city, only one of which is
occupied. One is an old ruined place that was built for the use of a
ruler who chanced to be regent for his father, and as he could not
reside in the Palace proper this smaller place was prepared for him.
The buildings now are in ruins, while the large grounds are used by the
foreign silk expert as a nursery for mulberry-trees.</p>
<p>The present Palace includes some hundreds of acres, and is the home
of more than three thousand attendants. The grounds are beautifully
diversified by little lakes of several acres in extent, one of which
surrounds a magnificent and stately pavilion, supported on great stone
pillars,&mdash;a fine picture and description of this, and other parts
of the Palace, may be found in Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chosen.&rdquo;
The other lake possesses a bright little pagoda-like pavilion, around
which plays a steam launch, dividing the lotus flowers which grow in
the water, and startling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>the swan, duck, and other aquatic
animals that make this their home.</p>
<p>These lakes are fed and drained by a mountain stream that enters and
leaves the Palace inclosure, through water-gates built under the walls.
Some of the bridges spanning this brook are quaint pieces of artistic
masonry, having animals carved in blocks of stone, represented in the
act of plunging into the liquid depths below. This carved stone work
abounds throughout the Palace buildings; the largest of which is the
great Audience-Hall, with its mast-like pillars supporting a ceiling at
an elevation of near one hundred feet above the tiled floor.</p>
<p>The dwelling-houses of the Royal Family are built upon the banks of
one of the small lakes, and are surrounded by walls for greater
seclusion. The rooms are furnished with costly articles from European
markets, together with the finest native furniture. Foreign-trained
cooks are employed, and the dinners sometimes given to distinguished
foreign guests are in entire accord with modern western methods.
Royalty is never present at these banquets, which are presided over by
one of the heads of departments; the Royal Family, maybe, witnessing
the novel sight from a secluded place where their presence may not be
known.</p>
<p>The King only leaves the Palace upon certain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>occasions, as when he goes to bow before the tombs
of his ancestors. On these occasions the streets are cleared of the
little straw-thatched booths of the petty retail merchants as well as
of all other unsightly objects. The street is roped off and sprinkled
with fresh earth, and the people don their holiday garb, for it is
indeed a great gala day to them. The procession is a gorgeous relic of
medi&aelig;val times, with bits of the present strangely incorporated.
There may be regiments of soldiers in the ancient fiery coats of mail,
preceded or followed by soldiers dressed in the queer hybrid uniforms
of the modern army, and bearing the bayoneted rifles of the present
day, instead of the quaint matchlock-guns and ugly spears of the
ancient guard. The wild, weird music of the native bands may be
followed by the tooting of the buglers of the modern soldiery.</p>
<p>The strange one-wheeled chair of an official, with its numbers of
pushers and supporters, will probably be followed by an artillery
company dragging Gatling guns. His Majesty himself will be borne in a
great throne-like chair of red work, supported on the shoulders of
thirty-two oddly attired bearers, while high officials in the
government service may be mounted on horse back, or borne in less
pretentious chairs. The length of the procession varies, but it is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>seldom less than an hour in passing a given
place.</p>
<p>The King is thirty-eight years of age. The Queen is one year his
senior. The Crown Prince is fifteen years old, and has no brothers or
sisters. Foreigners who have been granted an audience with the King are
always pleased with his affability and brightness. He is quick of
perception and very progressive. By having foreign newspapers
translated to him he keeps fully abreast of the times. He is
kind-hearted to a fault, and much concerned for the welfare of his
people. His word is law, and an official would never think of failing
to carry out his instructions or perish in the attempt. Owing to his
great seclusion and the amount of ceremony with which he is hedged in,
and the fact that, as a rule, nothing disagreeable must be brought to
his notice, he is somewhat at the mercy of his favorites; and a trusted
eunuch, having the King&rsquo;s ear continually, may become a great
power for good or bad as the case may be. As decapitation is the usual
punishment for most crimes, however, and as an official who should
deceive the King would probably meet with such an end, the
responsibility of the place is apt to sober an otherwise fickle mind
and insure honest reports. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=

<p class="first">The Koreans are great students of Nature. Nothing
seems to escape their attention as they plod through the fields or
saunter for pleasure over the green hills. A naturally picturesque
landscape is preserved in its freshness by the law that forbids the
cutting of timber or fuel in any but prescribed localities. The
necessity that compels the peasants to carefully rake together all the
dried grass and underbrush for fuel, causes even the rugged mountain
sides to present the appearance of a gentleman&rsquo;s well kept park,
from which the landscape gardener has been wisely excluded.</p>
<p>Nature&rsquo;s beauty in Korea may be said to be enhanced rather
than marred by the presence of man; since the bright tints of the ample
costume worn by all lends a quaint charm to the view. The soil-begrimed
white garments of the peasants at work in the fields are not especially
attractive at short range; but the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29"
href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>foot-traveller, clad in a
gorgeous gown of light-colored muslin, adds a pleasant touch to the
general effect, as he winds about the hills following one of the
&ldquo;short-cut&rdquo; paths; while the flowing robes of brightly
colored silk worn by the frequent parties of gentry who may be met,
strolling for recreation, are a positive attraction. Nor are these
groups uncommon. The climate during most of the year is so delightful;
the gentry are so pre-eminently a people of leisure, and are so fond of
sight-seeing, games, and music, that they may be continually met taking
a stroll through the country.</p>
<p>As has been said, nothing out-of-doors seems to have escaped their
attention. The flowers that carpet the earth from snow till snow have
each been named and their seasons are known.</p>
<p>The <i>mah-hah</i> in-doors throws out its pretty sessile blossoms
upon the leafless stem sometimes before the snows have left, as though
summer were borne upon winter&rsquo;s bare arm with no leafy spring to
herald her approach. Then the autumn snows and frosts often arrive
before the great chrysanthemums have ceased their blooming, while,
between the seasons of the two heralds, bloom myriads of pretty plants
that should make up a veritable botanical paradise. Summer finds the
whole hill-sides covered with the delicate fluffy bloom of the pink
azaleas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>summoning forth the bands of beauty seekers who
have already admired the peach and the plum orchards. Great beds of
nodding lilies of the valley usher in the harvest, and even the forest
trees occasionally add their weight of blossoms to the general
effect.</p>
<p>The coming and going of the birds is looked for, and the
peculiarities and music of each are known. As a rule, they are named in
accordance with the notes they utter; the pigeon is the
<i>pe-dul-key</i>; the crow the <i>kaw-mah-gue</i>; the swallow the
<i>chap-pie</i>, and so on. One bird&mdash;I think it is the
oriole&mdash;is associated with a pretty legend to the effect that,
once upon a time, one of the numerous ladies at court had a love affair
with one of the palace officials&mdash;a Mr. Kim. It was discovered,
and the poor thing lost her life. Her spirit could not be killed,
however, and, unappeased, it entered this bird, in which form she
returned to the palace and sang, &ldquo;<i>Kim-pul-lah-go</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Kim-pul, Kim-pul-lah-go</i>,&rdquo; then, receiving no
response, she would mournfully
entreat&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Kim-poh-go-sip-so</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Kim-poh-go-sip-so</i>.&rdquo; Now, in the language of Korea,
&ldquo;<i>Kim-pul-lah-go</i>&rdquo; means &ldquo;call Kim&rdquo; or
&ldquo;tell Kim to come,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Kim poh go sip
so</i>&rdquo; means &ldquo;I want to see Kim.&rdquo; So, even to this
day, the women and children feel sad when they hear these plaintive
notes, and unconsciously <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>their hearts go out in pity for the
poor lone lover who is ever searching in vain for her Kim.</p>
<p>Another bird of sadness is the cuckoo, and the women dislike to hear
its homesick notes echoing across the valleys.</p>
<p>The <i>pe chu kuh ruk</i> is a bird that sings in the wild mountain
places and warns people that robbers are near. When it comes to the
hamlets and sings, the people know that the rice crop will be a
failure, and that they will have to eat millet.</p>
<p>The crow is in great disfavor, as it eats dead dog, and brings the
dread fever&mdash;<i>Yim pyung</i>.</p>
<p>The magpie&mdash;that impudent, noisy nuisance,&mdash;however, is in
great favor, so much so that his great ugly nest is safe from human
disturbance, and his presence is quite acceptable, especially in the
morning. He seems to be the champion of the swallows that colonize the
thick roofs and build their little mud houses underneath the tiles, for
when one of the great lazy house-snakes comes out to sun himself after
a meal of young swallows, the bereaved parents and friends at once fly
off for the saucy magpie, who comes promptly and dashes at the
snake&rsquo;s head amid the encouraging jabbering of the swallows. They
usually succeed in driving the reptile under the tiles. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>Should the magpie come to the house with his (excuse for a) song in
the morning, good news may be expected during the day; father will
return from a long journey; brother will succeed in his (civil-service)
examination and obtain rank, or good news will be brought by post.
Should the magpie come in the afternoon with his jargon, a
guest&mdash;not a friend&mdash;may be expected with an appetite equal
to that of a family of children; while, if the magpie comes after dark,
thieves may be dreaded.</p>
<p>This office of house-guard is also bestowed upon the domestic goose.
Aside from its beauty, this bird is greatly esteemed for its daring in
promptly sounding an alarm, should any untimely visitor enter the
court, as well as for its bravery in boldly pecking at and, in some
cases, driving out the intruder.</p>
<p>The wild goose is one of the most highly prized birds in Korea. It
always participates in the wedding ceremonies; for no man would think
himself properly married had he not been presented by his bride with a
wild goose, even though the bird were simply hired for the occasion.
The reason for this is that these observing people once noticed that a
goose, whose mate was killed, returned to the place year after year to
mourn her loss; and such constancy they seek, by this pretty custom, to
commend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>to their wives. They further pledge each other at
this time in these words: &ldquo;Black is the hair that now crowns our
heads, yet when it has become as white as the fibres of the onion root,
we shall still be found faithful to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white heron seems to be the especial friend of man. Many are the
tales told of the assistance it has rendered individuals. In one case
the generous-hearted creature is said to have pecked off its bill in
its frantic attempts to ring a temple bell for the salvation of a man.
One of the early stories relates how a hunter, having shot an arrow
through the head of a snake that was about to devour some newly hatched
herons, was in turn saved by the mother bird, who pecked to death a
snake that had gotten into the man&rsquo;s stomach while he was
drinking at a spring. The pecking, further, was so expertly done as not
to injure the man.</p>
<p>The swallows are everywhere welcome, while the thievish sparrows are
killed as often as possible; the former live in the roofs of the
houses, and usually awaken the inmates by their delighted chattering at
each recurrence of dawn. A charming story is told of a swallow&rsquo;s
rewarding a kind man who had rescued it from a snake and bound up its
broken leg. The anecdote is too long to be related in this connection
further than to say that the bird gave the man a seed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>which,
being planted, brought him a vast fortune, while a seed given to his
wicked brother, who was cruel to the swallows, worked his ruin. The
bird held in the highest favor, however, is the stork. It is engraved
in jade and gold and embroidered in silk, as the insignia of rank for
the nobility. It is the bird that soars above the battle, and calls
down success upon the Korean arms. In its majestic flight it is
supposed to mount to heaven; hence its wisdom, for it is reputed to be
a very wise bird. A man was once said to have ridden to heaven on the
back of a huge stork, and judging from the great strength of a pair the
writer once had as pets, the people are warranted in believing that, in
the marvellous days of the ancients, these birds were used for purposes
of transportation.</p>
<p>The animals, too, have their stories, and in Korea, as in some other
parts of the world, the rabbit seems to come off best, as a rule. One
very good story is told concerning a scrape the rabbit got himself into
because of his curiosity, but out of which he extricated himself at the
expense of the whole fraternity of water animals.</p>
<p>It seems that on one occasion the king of fishes was a little
indiscreet, and while snapping greedily at a worm, got a hook through
his nose. He succeeded in breaking the line, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>escaped
having his royal bones picked by some hungry mortal, but he was still
in a great dilemma, for he could in no way remove the cruel hook.</p>
<p>His finny majesty grew very ill; all the officials of his kingdom
were summoned and met in solemn council. From the turtle to the whale,
each one wore an anxious expression, and did his best at thinking. At
last the turtle was asked for his opinion, and announced his firm
belief that a poultice made from the fresh eye of a rabbit would remove
the disorder of their sovereign at once. He was listened to
attentively, but his plan was conceded to be impracticable, since they
had no fresh rabbit eyes or any means of obtaining them. Then the
turtle again came to the rescue, and said that he had a passing
acquaintance with the rabbit, whom he had occasionally seen when
walking along the beach, and that he would endeavor to bring him to the
palace, if the doctors would then take charge of the work, for the
sight of blood disagreed with him, and he would ask to absent himself
from the further conduct of the case. He was royally thanked for his
offer, and sent off in haste, realizing full well that his career was
made in case he succeeded, while he would be very much unmade if he
failed.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas a very hot day as the fat turtle <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>dragged
himself up the hill-side, where he fortunately espied the rabbit. The
latter, having jumped away a short distance, cocked his ears, and
looked over his back to see who was approaching. Perceiving the turtle,
he went over and accosted him with, &ldquo;What are you doing away up
here, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply came up for a view. I have always heard that the
view over the water from your hills was excellent, but I can&rsquo;t
say it pays one for the trouble of coming up,&rdquo; and the turtle
wiped off his long neck and stretched himself out to cool off in the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not high enough; just come with me if you want to see
a view,&rdquo; and the rabbit straightened up as if to start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! I have had enough for once. I prefer the water.
Why, you should see the magnificent sights down there. There are
beautiful green forests of waving trees, mountains of cool stones,
valleys and caves, great open plains made beautiful by companies of
brightly robed fishes, royal processions from our palaces, and, best of
all, the water bears you up, and you go everywhere without exertion.
No, let me return, you have nothing on this dry, hot earth worth
seeing.&rdquo; The turtle turned to go, but the rabbit musingly
followed. At length he said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have any difficulty in the water?
Doesn&rsquo;t it get into your eyes and mouth?&rdquo; For he really
longed in his heart to see the strange sights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! it bothers us no more than air, after we have once
become accustomed to it,&rdquo; said the turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should very much like to see the place,&rdquo; said the
rabbit, rather to himself, &ldquo;but &rsquo;tis no use, I
couldn&rsquo;t live in the water like a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly not,&rdquo; and the turtle concealed his
excitement under an air of indifference; &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t get
along by yourself, but if you really wish to see something that will
surprise you, you may get on my back, give me your fore-paws, and I
will take you down all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some further assurance, the rabbit accepted the apparently
generous offer, and on arriving at the beach, he allowed himself to be
firmly fixed on the turtle&rsquo;s back, and down they went into the
water, to the great discomfort of the rabbit, who, however, eventually
became so accustomed to the water that he did not much mind it.</p>
<p>He was charmed and bewildered by the magnificence of every thing he
saw, and especially by the gorgeous palace, through which he was
escorted, by attendant fishes, to the sick chamber <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>of the
king, where he found a great council of learned doctors, who welcomed
him <i>very</i> warmly. While sitting in an elegant chair and gazing
about at the surrounding magnificence, he chanced to hear a discussion
concerning the best way of securing his eyes before he should die. He
was filled with horror, and, questioning an attendant, the whole plot
was explained to him. The poor fellow scratched his head and wondered
if he would ever get out of the place alive. At last a happy thought
struck him. He explained to them that he always carried about two pairs
of eyes, his real ones and a pair made of mountain crystals, to be used
in very dusty weather.</p>
<p>Fearing that the water would injure his real eyes, he had buried
them in the sand before getting upon the turtle&rsquo;s back, and was
now using his crystal ones. He further expressed himself as most
willing to let them have <i>one</i> of his real eyes, with which to
cure his majesty&rsquo;s disorder, and assured them that he believed
one eye would answer the purpose. He gave them to understand that he
felt highly honored in being allowed to assist in so important a work,
and declared that if they would give the necessary order he would
hasten on the turtle&rsquo;s back to the spot where he had buried the
eyes and return speedily with one. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"
href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>Marvelling much at the rabbit&rsquo;s courtesy, the fishes slunk
away into the corners for very shame at their own rude conduct in
forcibly kidnapping him, when a simple request would have accomplished
their purpose. The turtle was rather roughly commanded to carry the
guest to the place designated, which he did.</p>
<p>Once released by the turtle to dig for the eyes in the sand, the
rabbit shook the water from his coat, and winking at his clumsy
betrayer told him to dig for the eyes himself, that he had only one
pair, and those he intended to keep. With that he tore away up the
mountain side, and has ever after been careful to give the turtle a
wide berth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=

<h2 class="main">THE ENCHANTED WINE-JUG;</h2>
<h2 class="sub">OR, WHY THE CAT AND DOG ARE ENEMIES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In ancient times there lived an old gray-haired man by
the river&rsquo;s bank where the ferry-boats land. He was poor but
honest, and being childless, and compelled to earn his own food, he
kept a little wine-shop, which, small though it was, possessed quite a
local reputation, for the aged proprietor would permit no quarrelling
on his premises, and sold only one brand of wine, and this was of
really excellent quality. He did not keep a pot of broth simmering over
the coals at his door to tempt the passer-by, and thus increase his
thirst on leaving. The old man rather preferred the customers who
brought their little long-necked bottles, and carried the drink to
their homes. There were some peculiarities&mdash;almost
mysteries&mdash;about this little wine-shop; the old man had apparently
always been there, and had never seemed any younger. His wine never
gave out, no matter how great might be the local thirst, yet he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>never seen to make or take in a new supply; nor
had he a great array of vessels in his shop. On the contrary, he always
seemed to pour the wine out of the one and same old bottle, the long,
slender neck of which was black and shiny from being so often tipped in
his old hand while the generous, warming stream gurgled outward to the
bowl. This had long ceased to be a matter of inquiry, however, and only
upon the advent of a stranger of an inquiring mind would the subject be
re-discussed. The neighbors were assured that the old man was
thoroughly good, and that his wine was better. Furthermore, he sold it
as reasonably as other men sold a much inferior article. And more than
this, they did not care to know; or at least if they did once care,
they had gotten over it, and were now content to let well enough
alone.</p>
<p>I said the old man had no children. That is true, yet he had that
which in a slight degree took the place of children, in that they were
his daily care, his constant companions, and the partners of his bed
and board. These deputy children were none other than a good-natured
old dog, with laughing face and eyes, long silken ears that were ever
on the alert, yet too soft to stand erect, a chunky neck, and a large
round body covered with long soft tan hair and ending in a bushy tail.
He was the very impersonation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>of canine wisdom and good-nature, and
seldom became ruffled unless he saw his master worried by the ill
behavior of one of his patrons, or when a festive flea persisted in
attacking him on all sides at once. His fellow, a cat, would sometimes
assist in the onslaught, when the dog was about to be defeated and
completely ruffled by his tormentor.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo; was also a character in his own way, and
though past the days when his chief ambition had been to catch his
tail, he had such a strong vein of humor running through him that age
could not subdue his frivolous propensities. He had been known to drop
a dead mouse upon the dog&rsquo;s nose from the counter, while the
latter was endeavoring to get a quiet nap; and then he would blow his
tail up as a balloon, hump his back, and look utterly shocked at such
conduct, as the startled dog nearly jumped out of his skin, and
growling horribly, tore around as though he were either in chase of a
wild beast or being chased by one.</p>
<p>This happy couple lived in the greatest contentment with the old
man. They slept in the little <i>kang</i> room with him at night, and
enjoyed the warm stone floor, with its slick oil-paper covering, as
much as did their master. When the old man would go out on a mild
moonlit night to enjoy a pipe of tobacco and gaze at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>stars,
his companions would rush out and announce to the world that they were
not asleep, but ready to encounter any and every thing that the
darkness might bring forth, so long as it did not enter their
master&rsquo;s private court, of which they were in possession.</p>
<p>These two were fair-weather companions up to this time. They had not
been with the old man when a bowl of rice was a luxury. Their days did
not antedate the period of the successful wine-shop history. The old
man, however, often recalled those former days with a shudder, and
thought with great complacency of the time when he had befriended a
divine being, in the form of a weary human traveller, to whom he gave
the last drink his jug contained, and how, when the contents of the
little jug had gurgled down the stranger&rsquo;s throat in a long
unbroken draught, the stranger had given him a trifling little thing
that looked like a bit of amber, saying: &ldquo;Drop this into your
jug, old man, and so long as it remains there, you will never want for
a drink.&rdquo; He did so; and sure enough the jug was heavy with
something, so that he raised it to his lips, and&mdash;could he believe
it! a most delicious stream of wine poured down his parched throat.</p>
<p>He took the jug down and peered into its black depths; he shook its
sides, causing the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span>elf within to dance and laugh aloud; and
shutting his eyes, again he took another long draught; then meaning
well, he remembered the stranger, and was about to offer him a drink,
when he discovered that he was all alone, and began to wonder at the
strange circumstance, and to think what he was to do. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t sit here and drink all the time, or I will be drunk, and
some thief will carry away my jug. I can&rsquo;t live on wine alone,
yet I dare not leave this strange thing while I seek for
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like many another to whom fortune has just come, he knew not for a
time what to do with his good-luck. Finally he hit upon the scheme of
keeping a wine-shop, the success of which we have seen, and have
perhaps refused the old man credit for the wisdom he displayed in
continuing on in a small scale, rather than in exciting unpleasant
curiosity and official oppression, by turning up his jug and attempting
to produce wine at wholesale. The dog and cat knew the secret, and had
ever a watchful eye upon the jug, which was never for a moment out of
sight of one of the three pairs of eyes.</p>
<p>As the brightest day must end in gloom, however, so was this
pleasant state soon to be marred by a most sad and far-reaching
accident.</p>
<p>One day the news flashed around the neighborhood that the old
man&rsquo;s supply of wine was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>exhausted; not a drop remained
in his jug, and he had no more with which to refill it. Each man on
hearing the news ran to see if it were indeed true, and the little
straw-thatched hut and its small court encircled by a mud wall were
soon filled with anxious seekers after the truth. The old man admitted
the statement to be true, but had little to say; while the dog&rsquo;s
ears hung neglectedly over his cheeks, his eyes dropped, and he looked
as though he might be asleep, but for the persistent manner in which he
refused to lie down, but dignifiedly bore his portion of the sorrow
sitting upright, but with bowed head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas&rdquo; seemed to have been charged with agitation
enough for the whole family. He walked nervously about the floor till
he felt that justice to his tail demanded a higher plane, where shoes
could not offend, and then betook himself to the counter, and later to
the beam which supported the roof, and made a sort of cats' and rats'
attic under the thatch.</p>
<p>All condoled with the old man, and not one but regretted that their
supply of cheap, good wine was exhausted. The old man offered no
explanation, though he had about concluded in his own mind that, as no
one knew the secret, he must have in some way poured the bit of amber
into a customer&rsquo;s jug. But who possessed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>the jug
he could not surmise, nor could he think of any way of reclaiming it.
He talked the matter over carefully and fully to himself at night, and
the dog and cat listened attentively, winking knowingly at each other,
and puzzling their brains much as to what was to be done and how they
were to assist their kind old friend.</p>
<p>At last the old man fell asleep, and then sitting down face to face
by his side, the dog and cat began a discussion. &ldquo;I am
sure,&rdquo; says the cat, &ldquo;that I can detect that thing if I
only come within smelling distance of it; but how do we know where to
look for it.&rdquo; That was a puzzler, but the dog proposed that they
make a search through every house in the neighborhood. &ldquo;We can go
on a mere <i>kuh kyung</i> (look see), you know, and while you call on
the cats indoors, and keep your smellers open, I will <i>yay gee</i>
(chat) with the dogs outside, and if you smell any thing you can tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan seemed to be the only good one, and it was adopted that
very night. They were not cast down because the first search was
unsuccessful, and continued their work night after night. Sometimes
their calls were not appreciated, and in a few cases they had to clear
the field by battle before they could go on with the search. No house
was neglected, however, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>in due time they had done the whole
neighborhood, but with no success. They then determined that it must
have been carried to the other side of the river, to which place they
decided to extend their search as soon as the water was frozen over, so
that they could cross on the ice, for they knew they would not be
allowed in the crowded ferry-boats; and while the dog could swim, he
knew that the water was too icy for that. As it soon grew very cold,
the river froze so solidly that bull-carts, ponies, and all passed over
on the ice, and so it remained for near two months, allowing the
searching party to return each morning to their poor old master, who
seemed completely broken up by his loss, and did not venture away from
his door, except to buy the few provisions which his little fund of
savings would allow.</p>
<p>Time flew by without bringing success to the faithful comrades, and
the old man began to think they too were deserting him, as his old
customers had done. It was nearing the time for the spring thaw and
freshet, when one night as the cat was chasing around over the roof
timbers, in a house away to the outside of the settlement across the
river, he detected an odor that caused him to stop so suddenly as to
nearly precipitate himself upon a sleeping man on the floor below. He
carefully traced up the odor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>and found that it came from a
soapstone tobacco box that sat upon the top of a high clothes-press
near by. The box was dusty with neglect, and &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo;
concluded that the possessor had accidentally turned the coveted gem
(for it was from that the odor came) out into his wine bowl, and, not
knowing its nature, had put it into this stone box rather than throw it
away. The lid was so securely fastened that the box seemed to be one
solid piece, and in despair of opening it, the cat went out to consult
the superior wisdom of the dog, and see what could be done. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t get up there,&rdquo; said the dog, &ldquo;nor can you bring
me the box, or I might break it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot move the thing, or I might push it off, and let it
fall to the floor and break,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>
<p>So after explaining the things they could not do, the dog finally
hit upon a plan they might perhaps successfully carry out. &ldquo;I
will tell you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You go and see the chief of the
rat guild in this neighborhood, tell him that if he will help you in
this matter, we will both let him alone for ten years, and not hurt
even a mouse of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what good is that going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see, that stone is no harder than some
wood, and they can take turns at it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49"
href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>till they gnaw a hole through,
then we can easily get the gem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cat bowed before the marvellous judgment of the dog, and went
off to accomplish the somewhat difficult task of obtaining an interview
with the master rat. Meanwhile the dog wagged his ears and tail, and
strode about with a swinging stride, in imitation of the great <i>yang
ban</i>, or official, who occasionally walked past his master&rsquo;s
door, and who seemed to denote by his haughty gait his superiority to
other men. His importance made him impudent, and when the cat returned,
to his dismay, he found his friend engaged in a genuine fight with a
lot of curs who had dared to intrude upon his period of
self-congratulation. &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo; mounted the nearest wall, and
howled so lustily that the inmates of the house, awakened by the
uproar, came out and dispersed the contestants.</p>
<p>The cat had found the rat, who, upon being assured of safety, came
to the mouth of his hole, and listened attentively to the proposition.
It is needless to say he accepted it, and a contract was made
forthwith. It was arranged that work was to begin at once, and be
continued by relays as long as they could work undisturbed, and when
the box was perforated, the cat was to be summoned.</p>
<p>The ice had now broken up and the pair could not return home very
easily, so they waited about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>the neighborhood for some months,
picking up a scant living, and making many friends and not a few
enemies, for they were a proud pair, and ready to fight on
provocation.</p>
<p>It was warm weather, when, one night, the cat almost forgot his
compact as he saw a big fat rat slinking along towards him. He crouched
low and dug his long claws into the earth, while every nerve seemed on
the jump; but before he was ready to spring upon his prey, he
fortunately remembered his contract. It was just in time, too, for as
the rat was none other than the other party to the contract, such a
mistake at that time would have been fatal to their object.</p>
<p>The rat announced that the hole was completed, but was so small at
the inside end that they were at a loss to know how to get the gem out,
unless the cat could reach it with his paw. Having acquainted the dog
with the good news, the cat hurried off to see for himself. He could
introduce his paw, but as the object was at the other end of the box he
could not quite reach it. They were in a dilemma, and were about to
give up, when the cat went again to consult with the dog. The latter
promptly told them to put a mouse into the box, and let him bring out
the gem. They did so, but the hole was too small for the little fellow
and his load to get out at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href=
"#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>the same time, so that much pushing
and pulling had to be done before they were successful. They got it
safely at last, however, and gave it at once to the dog for
safe-keeping. Then, with much purring and wagging of tails, the
contract of friendship was again renewed, and the strange party broke
up; the rats to go and jubilate over their safety, the dog and cat to
carry the good news to their mourning master.</p>
<p>Again canine wisdom was called into play in devising a means for
crossing the river. The now happy dog was equal to such a trifling
thing as this, however, and instructed the cat that he must take the
gem in his mouth, hold it well between his teeth, and then mount his
(the dog&rsquo;s) back, where he could hold on firmly to the long hair
of his neck while he swam across the river. This was agreed upon, and
arriving at the river they put the plan into execution. All went well
until, as they neared the opposite bank, a party of school-children
chanced to notice them coming, and, after their amazement at the
strange sight wore away, they burst into uproarious laughter, which
increased the more they looked at the absurd sight. They clapped their
hands and danced with glee, while some fell on the ground and rolled
about in an exhaustion of merriment at seeing a cat astride a
dog&rsquo;s back being ferried across the river. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>The dog was too weary, and consequently matter-of-fact, to see much
fun in it, but the cat shook his sides till his agitation caused the
dog to take in great gulps of water in attempting to keep his head up.
This but increased the cat&rsquo;s merriment, till he broke out in a
laugh as hearty as that of the children, and in doing so dropped the
precious gem into the water. The dog, seeing the sad accident, dove at
once for the gem; regardless of the cat, who could not let go in time
to escape, and was dragged down under the water. Sticking his claws
into the dog&rsquo;s skin, in his agony of suffocation, he caused him
so much pain that he missed the object of his search, and came to the
surface.</p>
<p>The cat got ashore in some way, greatly angered at the dog&rsquo;s
rude conduct. The latter, however, cared little for that, and as soon
as he had shaken the water from his hide, he made a lunge at his
unlucky companion, who had lost the results of a half year&rsquo;s
faithful work in one moment of foolishness.</p>
<p>Dripping like a &ldquo;drowned cat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo; was,
however, able to climb a tree, and there he stayed till the sun had
dried the water from his fur, and he had spat the water from his
inwards in the constant spitting he kept up at his now enemy, who kept
barking ferociously about the tree below. The cat knew that the dog was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>dangerous when aroused, and was careful not to
descend from his perch till the coast was clear; though at one time he
really feared the ugly boys would knock him off with stones as they
passed. Once down, he has ever since been careful to avoid the dog,
with whom he has never patched up the quarrel. Nor does he wish to do
so, for the very sight of a dog causes him to recall that horrible cold
ducking and the day spent up a tree, and involuntarily he spits as
though still filled with river-water, and his tail blows up as it had
never learned to do till the day when for so long its damp and draggled
condition would not permit of its assuming the haughty shape. This
accounts for the scarcity of cats and the popularity of dogs.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e694src" href="#xd25e694" name=
"xd25e694src">1</a></p>
<p>The dog did not give up his efforts even now. He dove many times in
vain, and spent most of the following days sitting on the river&rsquo;s
bank, apparently lost in thought. Thus the winter found him&mdash;his
two chief aims apparently being to find the gem and to kill the cat.
The latter kept well out of his way, and the ice now covered the place
where the former lay hidden. One day he espied a man spearing fish
through a hole in the ice, as was very common. Having a natural desire
to be around where any thing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href=
"#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>eatable was being displayed, and
feeling a sort of proprietorship in the particular part of the river
where the man was fishing, and where he himself had had such a sad
experience, he went down and looked on. As a fish came up, something
natural seemed to greet his nostrils, and then, as the man lay down his
catch, the dog grabbed it and rushed off in the greatest haste. He ran
with all his might to his master, who, poor man, was now at the end of
his string (coin in Korea is perforated and strung on a string), and
was almost reduced to begging. He was therefore delighted when his
faithful old friend brought him so acceptable a present as a fresh
fish. He at once commenced dressing it, but when he slit it open, to
his infinite joy, his long-lost gem fell out of the fish&rsquo;s belly.
The dog was too happy to contain himself, but jumping upon his master,
he licked him with his tongue, and struck him with his paws, barking
meanwhile as though he had again treed the cat.</p>
<p>As soon as their joy had become somewhat natural, the old man
carefully placed the gem in his trunk, from which he took the last
money he had, together with some fine clothes&mdash;relics of his more
fortunate days. He had feared he must soon pawn these clothes, and had
even shown them to the brokers. But now he took them out to put them
on, as his fortune had returned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55"
href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>to him. Leaving the fish baking
on the coals, he donned his fine clothes, and taking his last money, he
went and purchased wine for his feast, and for a beginning; for he knew
that once he placed the gem back in the jug, the supply of wine would
not cease. On his return he and the good dog made a happy feast of the
generous fish, and the old man completely recovered his spirits when he
had quaffed deeply of the familiar liquid to which his mouth was now
such a stranger. Going to his trunk directly, he found to his amazement
that it contained another suit of clothes exactly like the first ones
he had removed, while there lay also a broken string of cash of just
the amount which he had previously taken out.</p>
<p>Sitting down to think, the whole truth dawned upon him, and he then
saw how he had abused his privilege before in being content to use his
talisman simply to run a wine-shop, while he might have had money and
every thing else in abundance by simply giving the charm a chance to
work.</p>
<p>Acting upon this principle, the old man eventually became immensely
wealthy, for he could always duplicate any thing with his piece of
amber. He carefully tended his faithful dog, who never in his remaining
days molested a rat, and never lost an opportunity to attack every cat
he saw. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=

<p class="first">Ching Yuh and Kyain Oo were stars attendant upon the
Sun. They fell madly in love with each other, and, obtaining the royal
permission, they were married. It was to them a most happy union, and
having reached the consummation of their joys they lived only for one
another, and sought only each other&rsquo;s company. They were
continually in each other&rsquo;s embrace, and as the honey-moon bade
fair to continue during the rest of their lives, rendering them unfit
for the discharge of their duties, their master decided to punish them.
He therefore banished them, one to the farthest edge of the eastern
heavens, the other to the extreme opposite side of the great river that
divides the heavenly plains (the Milky Way).</p>
<p>They were sent so far away that it required full six months to make
the journey, or a whole <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>year to go and come. As they must be
at their post at the annual inspection, they therefore could only hope
to journey back and forth for the scant comfort of spending one short
night in each other&rsquo;s company. Even should they violate their
orders and risk punishment by returning sooner, they could only see
each other from either bank of the broad river, which they could only
hope to cross at the season when the great bridge is completed by the
crows, who carry the materials for its construction upon their heads,
as any one may know, who cares to notice, how bald and worn are the
heads of the crows during the seventh moon.</p>
<p>Naturally this fond couple are always heart-broken and discouraged
at being so soon compelled to part after such a brief but long-deferred
meeting, and &lsquo;tis not strange that their grief should manifest
itself in weeping tears so copious that the whole earth beneath is
deluged with rains.</p>
<p>This sad meeting occurs on the night of the seventh day of the
seventh moon, unless prevented by some untoward circumstance, in which
case the usual rainy season is withheld, and the parched earth then
unites in lamentation with the fond lovers, whose increased trials so
sadden their hearts that even the fountain of tears refuses to flow for
their relief. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">You Tah Jung was a very wise official, and a
remarkably good man. He could ill endure the corrupt practices of many
of his associate officials, and becoming dissatisfied with life at
court, he sought and obtained permission to retire from official life
and go to the country. His marriage had fortunately been a happy one,
hence he was the more content with the somewhat solitary life he now
began to lead. His wife was peculiarly gifted, and they were in perfect
sympathy with each other, so that they longed not for the society of
others. They had one desire, however, that was ever before them and
that could not be laid aside. They had no children; not even a daughter
had been granted them.</p>
<p>As You Tah Jung superintended the cultivation of his estate, he felt
that he would be wholly happy and content were it not for the lack of
offspring. He gave himself up to the fascinating pastime of fishing,
and took great delight in spending the most of his time in the fields
listening to the birds and absorbing wisdom, with peace and
contentment, from nature. As spring brought the mating and budding
season, however, he again got to brooding over his unfortunate
condition. For as he was the last of an illustrious family, the line
seemed like to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>cease with his childless life. He knew of the
displeasure his ancestors would experience, and that he would be unable
to face them in paradise; while he would leave no one to bow before his
grave and make offerings to his spirit. Again he bemoaned their
condition with his poor wife, who begged him to avail himself of his
prerogative and remove their reproach by marrying another wife. This he
stoutly refused to do, as he would not risk ruining his now pleasant
home by bringing another wife and the usual discord into it.</p>
<p>Instead of estranging them, their misfortune seemed but to bind this
pair the closer together. They were very devout people, and they prayed
to heaven continually for a son. One night the wife fell asleep while
praying, and dreamed a remarkable dream. She fancied that she saw a
commotion in the vicinity of the North Star, and presently a most
beautiful boy came down to her, riding upon a wonderful fan made of
white feathers. The boy came direct to her and made a low obeisance,
upon which she asked him who he was and where he came from. He said:
&ldquo;I am the attendant of the great North Star, and because of a
mistake I fell into he banished me to earth for a term of years,
telling me to come to you and bring this fan, which will eventually be
the means of saving your life and my own.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the intensity of her joy she awoke, and found to her infinite
sorrow that the beautiful vision was but a dream. She cherished it in
her mind, however, and was transported with joy when a beautiful boy
came to them with the succeeding spring-tide. The beauty of the child
was the comment of the neighborhood, and every one loved him. As he
grew older it was noticed that the graces of his mind were even more
remarkable than those of his person.</p>
<p>The next ten years were simply one unending period of blissful
contentment in the happy country home. They called the boy Pang Noo
(his family name being You, made him You Pang Noo). His mother taught
him his early lessons herself, but by the expiration of his first ten
years he had grown far beyond her powers, and his brilliant mind even
taxed his intelligent father in his attempts to keep pace with him.</p>
<p>About this time they learned of a wonderful teacher, a Mr. Nam Juh
Oon, whose ability was of great repute. It was decided that the boy
should be sent to this man to school, and great was the agitation and
sorrow at home at <span class="corr" id="xd25e748" title=
"Not in source">the</span> thought of the separation. He was made
ready, however, and with the benediction of father and caresses of
mother, he started for his new teacher, bearing with him a wonderful
feather fan which his father had given him, and which had descended
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>from his great-grandfather. This he was to guard
with especial care, as, since his mother&rsquo;s remarkable dream,
preceding his birth, it was believed that this old family relic, which
bore such a likeness to the fan of the dream, was to prove a talisman
to him, and by it evil was to be warded off, and good brought down upon
him.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Strange as it may seem, events very similar in nature
to those just narrated were taking place in a neighboring district,
where lived another exemplary man named Cho Sung Noo. He was a man of
great rank, but was not in active service at present, simply because of
ill-health induced by constant brooding over his ill-fortune; for, like
You Tah Jung, he was the last of an illustrious family, and had no
offspring. He was so happily married, furthermore, that he had never
taken a second wife, and would not do so.</p>
<p>About the time of the events just related concerning the You family,
the wife of Cho, who had never neglected bowing to heaven and
requesting a child, dreamed. She had gone to a hill-side apart from the
house, and sitting in the moonlight on a clean plat of ground, free
from the litter of the domestic animals, she was gazing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>into the
heavens, hoping to witness the meeting of <i>Ching Yuh</i> and <i>Kyain
Oo</i>, and feeling sad at <span class="corr" id="xd25e768" title=
"Not in source">the</span> thought of their fabled tribulations. While
thus engaged she fell asleep, and while sleeping dreamed that the four
winds were bearing to her a beautiful litter, supported upon five rich,
soft clouds. In the chair reclined a beautiful little girl, far
lovelier than any being she had ever dreamed of before, and the like of
which is never seen in real life. The chair itself was made of gold and
jade. As the procession drew nearer the dreamer exclaimed: &ldquo;Who
are you, my beautiful child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the child, &ldquo;I am glad you think me
beautiful, for then, may be, you will let me stay with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I should like to have you very much, but you
haven&rsquo;t yet answered my question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was an attendant upon the
Queen of Heaven, but I have been very bad, though I meant no wrong, and
I am banished to earth for a season; won&rsquo;t you let me live with
you, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted, my child, for we have no children. But
what did you do that the stars should banish you from their
midst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will tell you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You see,
when the annual union of Ching Yuh and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>Kyain Oo takes place, I
hear them mourning because they can only see each other once a year,
while mortal pairs have each other&rsquo;s company constantly. They
never consider that while mortals have but eighty years of life at
most, their lives are without limit, and they, therefore, have each
other to a greater extent than do the mortals, whom they selfishly
envy. In a spirit of mischief I determined to teach this unhappy couple
a lesson; consequently, on the last seventh moon, seventh day, when the
bridge was about completed and ready for the eager pair to cross
heaven&rsquo;s river to each others' embrace, I drove the crows away,
and ruined their bridge before they could reach each other. I did it
for mischief, &rsquo;tis true, and did not count on the drought that
would occur, but for my misconduct and the consequent suffering
entailed on mortals, I am banished, and I trust you will take and care
for me, kind lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had finished speaking, the winds began to blow around as
though in preparation for departure with the chair, minus its occupant.
Then the woman awoke and found it but a dream, though the winds were,
indeed, blowing about her so as to cause her to feel quite chilly. The
dream left a pleasant impression, and when, to their intense joy, a
daughter was really born to them, the fond parents could scarcely be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>blamed for associating her somewhat with the
vision of the ravishing dream.</p>
<p>The child was a marvel of beauty, and her development was rapid and
perfect. The neighbors were so charmed with her, that some of them
seemed to think she was really supernatural, and she was popularly
known as the &ldquo;divine maiden,&rdquo; before her first ten years
were finished.</p>
<p>It was about the time of her tenth birthday that little Uhn Hah had
the interesting encounter upon which her whole future was to hinge.</p>
<p>It happened in this way: One day she was riding along on her nurses'
back, on her way to visit her grandmother. Coming to a nice shady spot
they sat down by the road-side to rest. While they were sitting there,
along came Pang Noo on his way to school. As Uhn Hah was still but a
girl she was not veiled, and the lad was confronted with her matchless
beauty, which seemed to intoxicate him. He could not pass by, neither
could he find words to utter, but at last he bethought him of an
expedient. Seeing some oranges in her lap, he stepped up and spoke
politely to the nurse, saying, &ldquo;I am You Pang Noo, a lad on my
way to school, and I am very thirsty, won&rsquo;t you ask your little
girl to let me have one of her oranges?&rdquo; Uhn <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>Hah was
likewise smitten with the charms of the beautiful lad, and in her
confusion she gave him two oranges. Pang Noo gallantly said, &ldquo;I
wish to give you something in return for your kindness, and if you will
allow me I will write your name on this fan and present it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having obtained the name and permission, he wrote: &ldquo;No girl
was ever possessed of such incomparable graces as the beautiful Uhn
Hah. I now betroth myself to her, and vow never to marry other so long
as I live.&rdquo; He handed her the fan, and feasting his eyes on her
beauty, they separated. The fan being closed, no one read the
characters, and Uhn Hah carefully put it away for safe keeping without
examining it sufficiently close to discover the written sentiment.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Pang Noo went to school and worked steadily for three
years. He learned amazingly fast, and did far more in three years than
the brightest pupils usually do in ten. His noted teacher soon found
that the boy could even lead him, and it became evident that further
stay at the school was unnecessary. The boy also was very anxious to go
and see his parents. At last he bade his teacher good-by, to the sorrow
of both, for their companionship had been very pleasant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>and
profitable, and they had more than the usual attachment of teacher and
pupil for each other. Pang Noo and his attendant journeyed leisurely to
their home, where they were received with the greatest delight. His
mother had not seen her son during his schooling, and even her fond
pride was hardly prepared for the great improvement the boy had made,
both in body and mind, since last she saw him. The father eventually
asked to see the ancestral fan he had given him, and the boy had to
confess that he had it not, giving as an excuse that he had lost it on
the road. His father could not conceal his anger, and for some time
their pleasure was marred by this unfortunate circumstance. Such a
youth and an only son could not long remain unforgiven, however, and
soon all was forgotten, and he enjoyed the fullest love of his parents
and admiration of his friends as he quietly pursued his studies and
recreation.</p>
<p>In this way he came down to his sixteenth year, the pride of the
neighborhood. His quiet was remarked, but no one knew the secret cause,
and how much of his apparent studious attention was devoted to the
charming little maiden image that was framed in his mental vision.
About this time a very great official from the neighborhood called upon
his father, and after the usual formalities, announced that he had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>heard of the remarkable son You Tah Jung was the
father of, and he had come to consult upon the advisability of uniting
their families, as he himself had been blessed with a daughter who was
beautiful and accomplished. You Tah Jung was delighted at the prospect
of making such a fine alliance for his son, and gave his immediate
consent, but to his dismay, his son objected so strenuously and withal
so honorably that the proposition had to be declined as graciously as
the rather awkward circumstances would allow. Both men being sensible,
however, they but admired the boy the more, for the clever rascal had
begged his father to postpone all matrimonial matters, as far as he was
concerned, till he had been able to make a name for himself, and had
secured rank, that he might merit such attention.</p>
<p>Pang Noo was soon to have an opportunity to distinguish himself. A
great <i>quaga</i> (civil-service examination) was to be held at the
capital, and Pang Noo announced his intention of entering the lists and
competing for civil rank. His father was glad, and in due time started
him off in proper style. The examination was held in a great enclosure
at the rear of the palace, where the King and his counsellors sat in a
pavilion upon a raised stage of masonry. The hundreds of men and youths
from all parts of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span>the country were seated upon the ground under
large umbrellas. Pang Noo was given a subject, and soon finished his
essay, after which he folded it up carefully and tossed the manuscript
over a wall into an enclosure, where it was received and delivered to
the board of examiners. These gentlemen, as well as His Majesty, were
at once struck with the rare merit of the production, and made instant
inquiry concerning the writer. Of course he was successful, and a
herald soon announced that Pang, the son of You Tah Jung had taken the
highest honors. He was summoned before the King, who was pleased with
the young man&rsquo;s brightness and wisdom. In addition to his own
rank, his father was made governor of a province, and made haste to
come to court and thank his sovereign for the double honor, and to
congratulate his son.</p>
<p>Pang was given permission to go and bow at the tomb of his
ancestors, in grateful acknowledgment for Heaven&rsquo;s blessings.
Having done which, he went to pay his respects to his mother, who
fairly worshipped her son now, if she had not done so before. During
his absence the King had authorized the board of appointments to give
him the high rank of <i>Ussa</i>, for, though he was young, His Majesty
thought one so wise and quick, well fitted to travel in disguise and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>spy out the acts of evil officials, learn the
condition of the people, and bring the corrupt and usurous to
punishment. Pang Noo was amazed at his success, yet the position just
suited him, for, aside from a desire to better the condition of his
fellow-men, he felt that in this position he would be apt to learn the
whereabouts of his lady-love, whose beautiful vision was ever before
him. Donning a suitable disguise, therefore, he set out upon the
business at hand with a light heart.</p>

<p class="first">Uhn Hah during all this time had been progressing in a
quiet way as a girl should, but she also was quite the wonder of her
neighborhood. All this time she had had many, if not constant, dreams
of the handsome youth she had met by the roadside. She had lived over
the incident time and again, and many a time did she take down and gaze
upon the beautiful fan, which, however, opened and closed in such a
manner that, ordinarily, the characters were concealed. At last,
however, she discovered them, and great was her surprise and delight at
the message. She dwelt on it much, and finally concluded it was a
heaven arranged union, and as the lad had pledged his faith to her, she
vowed she would be his, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=
"#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>never marry at all. This thought she
nourished, longing to see Pang Noo, and wondering how she should ever
find him, till she began to regard herself as really the wife of her
lover.</p>
<p>About this time one of His Majesty&rsquo;s greatest generals, who
had a reputation for bravery and cruelty as well, came to stop at his
country holding near by, and hearing of the remarkable girl, daughter
of the retired, but very honorable, brother official, he made a call at
the house of Mr. Cho, and explained that he was willing to betroth his
son to Cho&rsquo;s daughter. The matter was considered at length, and
Cho gave his willing consent. Upon the departure of the General, the
father went to acquaint his daughter with her good fortune. Upon
hearing it, she seemed struck dumb, and then began to weep and moan, as
though some great calamity had befallen her. She could say nothing, nor
bear to hear any more said of the matter. She could neither eat nor
sleep, and the roses fled from her tear-bedewed cheeks. Her parents
were dismayed, but wisely abstained from troubling her. Her mother,
however, betimes lovingly coaxed her daughter to confide in her, but it
was long before the girl could bring herself to disclose a secret so
peculiar and apparently so unwomanly. The mother prevailed at last, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>the whole story of the early infatuation
eventually came forth. &ldquo;He has pledged himself to me,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;he recognized me at sight as his heaven-sent bride, and I
have pledged myself to him. I cannot marry another, and, should I never
find him on earth, this fan shall be my husband till death liberates my
spirit to join his in the skies.&rdquo; She enumerated his great charms
of manner and person, and begged her mother not to press this other
marriage upon her, but rather let her die, insisting, however, that
should she die her mother must tell Pang Noo how true she had been to
him.</p>
<p>The father was in a great dilemma. &ldquo;Why did you not tell this
to your mother before? Here the General has done me the honor to ask
that our families be united, and I have consented. Now I must decline,
and his anger will be so great that he will ruin me at the Capitol. And
then, after all, this is but an absurd piece of childish foolishness.
Your fine young man, had he half the graces you give him, would have
been betrothed long before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;he has pledged himself,
and I know he is even now coming to me. He will not marry another, nor
can I. Would you ask one woman to marry two men? Yet that is what you
ask in this, for I am already the wife of Pang Noo in my heart.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>Kill me, if you will, but spare me this, I beg and
entreat,&rdquo; and she writhed about on her cot, crying till the mat
was saturated with her tears.</p>
<p>The parents loved her too well to withstand her pleadings, and
resigning themselves to the inevitable persecution that must result,
they dispatched a letter to the General declining his kind offer, in as
unobjectionable a manner as possible. It had the result that was
feared. The General, in a towering rage, sent soldiers to arrest Mr.
Cho, but before he could go further, a messenger arrived from Seoul
with despatches summoning him to the Capitol immediately, as a
rebellion had broken out on the borders. Before leaving, however, he
instructed the local magistrate to imprison the man and not release him
till he consented to the marriage. It chanced that the magistrate was
an honest man and knew the General to be a very cruel, relentless
warrior. He therefore listened to Cho&rsquo;s story, and believed the
strange case. Furthermore, his love for the girl softened his heart,
and he bade them to collect what they could and go to another province
to live. Cho did so, with deep gratitude to the magistrate, while the
latter wrote to the General that the prisoner had avoided arrest and
fled to unknown parts, taking his family with him. <span class=

<p class="first">Poor Pang Noo did his inspection work with a heavy
heart as time wore on, and the personal object of his search was not
attained. In the course of his travels he finally came to his uncle,
the magistrate who had dismissed the Cho family. The uncle welcomed his
popular nephew right warmly, but questioned him much as to the cause of
his poor health and haggard looks, which so ill-became a man of his
youth and prospects. At last the kind old man secured the secret with
its whole story, and then it was his turn to be sad, for had he not
just sent away the very person the <i>Ussa</i> so much desired to
see?</p>
<p>When Pang learned this his malady increased, and he declared he
could do no more active service till this matter was cleared up.
Consequently he sent a despatch to court begging to be released, as he
was in such poor health he could not properly discharge his arduous
duties longer. His request was granted, and he journeyed to Seoul,
hoping to find some trace of her who more and more seemed to absorb his
every thought and ambition.</p>

<p class="first">In the meantime the banished family, heart-sick and
travel-worn, had settled temporarily in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>a distant hamlet, where
the worn and discouraged parents were taken sick. Uhn Hah did all she
could for them, but in spite of care and attention, in spite of prayers
and tears, they passed on to join their ancestors. The poor girl beat
her breast and tore her hair in an agony of despair. Alone in a strange
country, with no money and no one to shield and support her, it seemed
that she too must, perforce, give up. But her old nurse urged her to
cheer up, and suggested their donning male attire, in which disguise
they could safely journey to another place unmolested.</p>
<p>The idea seemed a good one, and it was adopted. They allowed their
hair to fall down the back in a long braid, after the fashion of the
unmarried men, and, putting on men&rsquo;s clothes, they had no trouble
in passing unnoticed along the roads. After having gone but a short
distance they found themselves near the capital of the
province&mdash;the home of the Governor. While sitting under some trees
by the roadside the Governor&rsquo;s procession passed by. The couple
arose respectfully, but the Governor (it was Pang Noo&rsquo;s father),
espying the peculiar feather fan, ordered one of the runners to seize
the women and bring them along. It was done; and when they were arrived
at the official yamen, he questioned <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>the supposed man as to
where he had secured that peculiar fan. &ldquo;It is a family
relic,&rdquo; replied Uhn Hah, to the intense amazement of the
Governor, who pronounced the statement false, as the fan was a peculiar
feature in his own family, and must be one that had descended from his
own ancestors and been found or stolen by the present possessor.</p>
<p>However, the Governor offered to pay a good round sum for the fan.
But Uhn Hah declared she would die rather than part with it, and the
two women in disguise were locked up in prison. A man of clever speech
was sent to interview them, and he offered them a considerable sum for
the fan, which the servant urged Uhn Hah to take, as they were sadly in
want. After the man had departed in disgust, however, the girl
upbraided her old nurse roundly for forsaking her in her time of trial.
&ldquo;My parents are dead,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All I have to
represent my husband is this fan that I carry in my bosom. Would you
rob me of this? Never speak so again if you wish to retain my
love&rdquo;; and, weeping, she fell into the servant&rsquo;s arms,
where, exhausted and overwrought nature asserting itself, sleep closed
her eyes.</p>
<p>While sleeping she dreamed of a wonderful palace on high, where she
saw a company of women, who pointed her to the blood-red reeds
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>that lined the river bank below, explaining that
their tears had turned to blood during their long search for their
lovers, and dropping on the reeds they were dyed blood-red. One of them
prophesied, however, that Uhn Hah was to be given superhuman strength
and powers, and that she would soon succeed in finding her lover, who
was now a high official, and so true to her that he was sick because he
could not find her. She awakened far more refreshed by the dream than
by the nap, and was soon delighted by being dismissed. The
Governor&rsquo;s steward took pity on the handsome &ldquo;boy,&rdquo;
and gave him a parting gift of wine and food to carry with them, as
well as some cash to help them on, and, bidding him good-by, the women
announced their intention of travelling to a distant province.</p>

<p class="first">Meanwhile Pang Noo had reached home, and was weary
both in body and mind. The King offered him service at court, but he
asked to be excused, and seemed to wish to hide himself and avoid
meeting people. His father marvelled much at this, and again urged the
young man to marry; but this seemed only to aggravate his complaint.
His uncle happened to come to his father&rsquo;s gubernatorial seat on
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>business errand, and in pity for the young man,
explained the cause of the trouble to the father. He saw it all, and
recalled the strange beauty of the lad who had risked his life for the
possession of the fan, and as the uncle told the story of her excellent
parentage, and the trouble and death that resulted from the refusal to
marry, he saw through the whole strange train of circumstances, and
marvelled that heaven should have selected such an exemplary maiden for
his son. And then, as he realized how nearly he had come to punishing
her severely, for her persistent refusal to surrender the fan, and
that, whereas, he might have retained her and united her to his son, he
had sent her away unattended to wander alone; he heaped blame upon the
son in no stinted manner for his lack of confidence in not telling his
father his troubles. The attendants were carefully questioned
concerning the conduct of the strange couple while in custody at the
governor&rsquo;s yamen, and as to the probable direction they took in
departure. The steward alone could give information. He was well
rewarded for having shown them kindness, but his information cast a
gloom upon the trio, for he said they had started for the district
where civil war was in progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You unnatural son,&rdquo; groaned the father. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>&ldquo;What have you done? You secretly pledge
yourself to this noble girl, and then, by your foolish silence, twice
allow her to escape, while you came near being the cause of her death
at the very hands of your father; and even now by your foolishness she
is journeying to certain death. Oh, my son! we have not seen the last
of this rash conduct; this noble woman&rsquo;s blood will be upon our
hands, and you will bring your poor father to ruin and shame. Up! Stop
your lovesick idling, and do something. Ask His Majesty, with my
consent, for military duty; go to the seat of war, and there find your
wife or your honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father&rsquo;s advice was just what was needed; the son could
not, of necessity, disobey, nor did he wish to; but arming himself with
the courage of a desperate resolve to save his sweetheart, whom he
fancied already in danger from the rebels, he hurried to Seoul, and
surprising his sovereign by his strange and ardent desire for military
service, easily secured the favor, for the general in command was the
same who had wished to marry his son to Uhn Hah; he was also an enemy
to Pang Noo&rsquo;s father, and would like to see the only son of his
enemy killed.</p>
<p>With apparently strange haste the expedition was started off, and no
time was lost on the long, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>hard march. Arriving near the seat of
war, the road led by a mountain, where the black weather-worn stone was
as bare as a wall, sloping down to the road. Fearing lest he was going
to his death, the young commander had some characters cut high on the
face of the rock, which read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Standing at the gate of war, I, You Pang Noo, humbly bow to
Heaven&rsquo;s decree. Is it victory, or is it death? Heaven alone
knows the issue. My only remaining desire is to behold the face of my
lady Cho Gah.&rdquo; He put this inscription in this conspicuous place,
with the hope that if she were in the district she would see it, and
not only know he was true to her, but also that she might be able to
ascertain his whereabouts and come to him. He met the rebels, and
fought with a will, bringing victory to the royal arms. But soon their
provisions gave out, and, though daily despatches arrived, no rations
were sent in answer to their constant demands. The soldiers sickened
and died. Many more, driven mad by hardship and starvation, buried
their troubles deep in the silent river, which their loyal spears had
stained crimson with their enemies blood.</p>
<p>You Pang Noo was about to retire against orders, when the rebels,
emboldened by the weak condition of their adversaries, came in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>force, conquered and slew the remnant, and would
have slain the commander but for the counsel of two of their number,
who urged that he be imprisoned and held for ransom.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Again fate had interfered to further separate the
lovers, for, instead of continuing her journey, Uhn Hah had received
news that induced her to start for Seoul. While resting, on one
occasion, they had some conversation with a passer-by. He was from the
capital, and stated that he had gone there from a place near Uhn
Hah&rsquo;s childhood home as an attendant of the <i>Ussa</i> You Pang
Noo, who had taken sick at his uncle&rsquo;s, the magistrate, and had
gone to Seoul, where he was excused from <i>ussa</i> duty and offered
service at court. He knew not of the recent changes, but told his eager
listener all he knew of Pang Noo&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>The weary, foot-sore girl and her companion turned their faces
toward the capital, hoping at last to be rewarded by finding the object
of their search. That evening darkness overtook them before they had
found shelter, and spying a light through the trees, they sought it
out, and found a little hut occupied by an old man. He was reading a
book, but laid it aside as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>they answered his invitation to
enter, given in response to their knock. The usual salutations were
exchanged, but instead of asking who the visitors were, where they
lived, etc., etc., the old man called her by her true name, Cho Nang
Jah. &ldquo;I am not a Nang Jah&rdquo; (a female appellation), she
exclaimed; &ldquo;I am a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I know you, laughed the old man; &ldquo;you are Cho Nang
Jah in very truth, and you are seeking your future husband in this
disguise. But you are perfectly safe here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me no questions,&rdquo; said he, as she was about to
utter some surprised inquiries. &ldquo;I have been waiting for you and
expecting you. You are soon to do great things, for which I will
prepare you. Never mind your hunger, but devour this pill; it will give
you superhuman strength and courage.&rdquo; He gave her a pill of great
size, which she ate, and then fell asleep on the floor. The old man
went away, and soon the tired servant slept also. When they awoke it
was bright morning, and the birds were singing in the trees above them,
which were their only shelter, for the hut of the previous evening had
disappeared entirely, as had also the old man. Concluding that the old
man must be some heaven-sent messenger, she devoutly bowed herself in
grateful acknowledgment of the gracious manifestation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>Journeying on, they soon came to a wayside inn kept by an old
farmer, and here they procured food. While they were eating, a blind
man was prophesying for the people. When he came to Uhn Hah he said:
&ldquo;This is a woman in disguise; she is seeking for her husband, who
is fighting the rebels, and searching for her. He is now nearly dead;
but he will not die, for she will rescue him.&rdquo; On hearing this
she was delighted and sad at the same time, and explaining some of her
history to the master of the house, he took her in with the women and
treated her kindly. She was very anxious to be about her work, however,
since heaven had apparently so clearly pointed it out to her, and,
bidding the simple but kind friends good-by, she started for the seat
of war, where she arrived after a long, tedious, but uneventful
tramp.</p>
<p>Almost the first thing she saw was the inscription on the rocks left
by the very one she sought, and she cried bitterly at <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e917" title="Not in source">the</span> thought that
maybe she was too late. The servant cheered her up, however, by
reciting the blind man&rsquo;s prophecy, and they went on their way
till they came to a miserable little inn, where they secured lodging.
After being there some time, Uhn Hah noticed that the innkeeper&rsquo;s
wife was very sad, and continually in tears. She therefore questioned
her as to the cause of her grief. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83"
href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>&ldquo;I am mourning over the
fate of the poor starved soldiers, killed by the neglect of some one at
Seoul, and for the brave young officer, You Pang Noo, whom the rebels
have carried away captive.&rdquo; At this Uhn Hah fainted away, and the
nurse made such explanation as she could. Restoratives were applied,
and she slowly recovered, when, on further questioning, it was found
that the inn-people were slaves of You Pang Noo, and had followed him
thus far. It was also learned that the absence of stores was generally
believed to be due to the corrupt general-in-chief, who not only hated
his gallant young officer, but was unwilling to let him achieve glory,
so long as he could prevent it.</p>
<p>After consultation, and learning further of the matter, Uhn Hah
wrote a letter explaining the condition of affairs, and dispatched it
to Pang Noo&rsquo;s father by the innkeeper. The Governor was not at
his country place, and the messenger had to go to Seoul, where, to his
horror, he found that his old master was in prison, sent there by the
influence of the corrupt General, his enemy, because his son had been
accused of being a traitor, giving over the royal troops to the rebels,
and escaping with them himself. The innkeeper, however, secured access
to the prison, and delivered the letter to the unfortunate parent. Of
course, nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>could be done, and again he blamed his son for his
stupid secrecy in concealing his troubles from his father, and thus
bringing ruin upon the family and injury to the young lady. However, he
wrote a letter to the good uncle, relating the facts, and requesting
him to find the girl, place her in his home, and care for her as
tenderly as possible. He could do nothing more. The innkeeper delivered
this letter to the uncle, and was then instructed to carry a litter and
attendants to his home and bring back the young lady, attired in
suitable garments. He did so as speedily as possible, though the
journey was a long and tedious one.</p>
<p>Once installed in a comfortable home poor Uhn Hah became more and
more lonely. She seemed to have nothing now to hope for, and the
stagnation of idleness was more than she could endure. She fancied her
lover in prison, and suffering, while she was in the midst of comfort
and luxury. She could not endure the thought, and prevailed upon her
benefactor to convey to His Majesty a petition praying that she be
given a body of soldiers and be allowed to go and punish the rebels,
reclaim the territory, and liberate her husband. The King marvelled
much at such a request, coming from one of her retiring, seclusive sex,
and upon the advice of the wicked General, who was still in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>command, the petition was not granted. Still she
persisted, and found other ways of reaching the throne, till the King,
out of curiosity to see such a brave and loyal woman, bade her come
before him.</p>
<p>When she entered the royal presence her beauty and dignity of
carriage at once won attention and respectful admiration, so that her
request was about to be granted, when the General suggested, as a last
resort, that she first give some evidence of her strength and prowess
before the national military reputation be entrusted to her keeping. It
seemed a wise thought, and the King asked her what she could do to show
that she was warranted in heading such a perilous expedition. She
breathed a prayer to her departed parents for help, and remembering the
strange promise of the old man who gave her the pill, she felt that she
could do almost any thing, and seizing a large weather-worn stone that
stood in an ornamental rock basin in the court, she threw it over the
enclosing wall as easily as two men would have lifted it from the
ground. Then, taking the General&rsquo;s sword, she began slowly to
manipulate it, increasing gradually, as though in keeping with hidden
music, till the movement became so rapid that the sword seemed like one
continuous ring of burning steel&mdash;now in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>air, now
about her own person, and, again, menacingly near the wicked General,
who cowered in abject terror before the remarkable sight. His Majesty
was completely captivated, and himself gave the orders for her
expedition, raising her to relative rank, and giving her the choicest
battalion of troops. In her own peculiarly dignified way she expressed
her gratitude, and, bowing to the ground, went forth to execute her
sovereign&rsquo;s commands, and attain her heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>Again donning male attire, she completed her preparations, and
departed with eager delight to accomplish her mission. The troops
having obtained an inkling of the strange character and almost
supernatural power of their handsome, dashing leader, were filled with
courage and eager for the fray. But to the dismay of all, they had no
sooner arrived at the rebel infested country than severe rains began to
fall, making it impossible to accomplish any thing. This was explained,
however, by the spirits of the departed soldiers, who appeared to the
officers in dreams, and announced that as they had been sacrificed by
the cruel General, who had intentionally withheld their rations, they
would allow no success to the royal arms till their death was avenged
by his death. This was dispatched to court, and believed by His
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>Majesty, who had heard similar reports, oft
repeated. He therefore confined the General in prison, and sent his son
(the one who wished to marry Uhn Hah) to the front to be executed.</p>
<p>He was slain and his blood scattered to the winds. A feast was
prepared for the spirits of the departed soldiers, and this sacrifice
having been made, the storm ceased, the sun shone, and the royal troops
met and completely vanquished the rebels, restoring peace to the
troubled districts, but not obtaining the real object of the leaders'
search. After much questioning, among the captives, a man was found who
knew all about You Pang Noo, and where he was secreted. Upon the
promise of pardon, he conducted a party who rescued the captive and
brought him before their commander. Of course for a time the lovers
could not recognize each other after the years that had elapsed since
their first chance meeting.</p>
<p>You Pang Noo was given command and Uhn Hah modestly retired, adopted
her proper dress, and was borne back to Seoul in a litter. The whole
country rang with their praises. You Pang Noo was appointed governor of
a province, and the father was reinstated in office, while the General
who had caused the trouble was ignominiously put to death, and his
whole family and his estates were confiscated. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>As Cho Uhn Hah had no parents, His Majesty determined that she
should have royal patronage, and decreed that their wedding should take
place in the great hall where the members of the royal family are
united in marriage. This was done with all the pomp and circumstance of
a royal wedding, and no official stood so high in the estimation of the
King, as the valiant, true-hearted You, while the virtues of his spouse
were the subject of songs and ballads, and she was extolled as the
model for the women of the country. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89"

<p class="first">In the province of Chullado, in Southern Korea, lived
two brothers. One was very rich, the other very poor. For in dividing
the inheritance, the elder brother, instead of taking the
father&rsquo;s place, and providing for the younger children, kept the
whole property to himself, allowing his younger brother nothing at all,
and reducing him to a condition of abject misery. Both men were
married. Nahl Bo, the elder, had many concubines, in addition to his
wife, but had no children; while Hyung Bo had but one wife and several
children. The former&rsquo;s wives were continually quarrelling; the
latter lived in contentment and peace with his wife, each endeavoring
to help the other bear the heavy burdens circumstances had placed upon
them. The elder brother lived in a fine, large compound, with warm,
comfortable houses; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>younger had built himself a hut of
broom straw, the thatch of which was so poor that when it rained they
were deluged inside, upon the earthern floor. The room was so small,
too, that when Hyung Bo stretched out his legs in his sleep his feet
were apt to be thrust through the wall. They had no <i>kang</i>, and
had to sleep upon the cold dirt floor, where insects were so abundant
as to often succeed in driving the sleepers out of doors.</p>
<p>They had no money for the comforts of life, and were glad when a
stroke of good fortune enabled them to obtain the necessities. Hyung Bo
worked whenever he could get work, but rainy days and dull seasons were
a heavy strain upon them. The wife did plain sewing, and together they
made straw sandals for the peasants and vendors. At fair time the
sandal business was good, but then came a time when no more food was
left in the house, the string for making the sandals was all used up,
and they had no money for a new supply. Then the children cried to
their mother for food, till her heart ached for them, and the father
wandered off in a last attempt to get something to keep the breath of
life in his family.</p>
<p>Not a kernel of rice was left. A poor rat which had cast in his lot
with this kind family, became desperate when, night after night, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>chased around the little house without being able
to find the semblance of a meal. Becoming desperate, he vented his
despair in such loud squealing that he wakened the neighbors, who
declared that the mouse said his legs were worn off running about in a
vain search for a grain of rice with which to appease his hunger. The
famine became so serious in the little home, that at last the mother
commanded her son to go to his uncle and tell him plainly how
distressed they were, and ask him to loan them enough rice to subsist
on till they could get work, when they would surely return the
loan.</p>
<p>The boy did not want to go. His uncle would never recognize him on
the street, and he was afraid to go inside his house lest he should
whip him. But the mother commanded him to go, and he obeyed. Outside
his uncle&rsquo;s house were many cows, well fed and valuable. In pens
he saw great fat pigs in abundance, and fowls were everywhere in great
numbers. Many dogs also were there, and they ran barking at him,
tearing his clothes with their teeth and frightening him so much that
he was tempted to run; but speaking kindly to them, they quieted down,
and one dog came and licked his hand as if ashamed of the conduct of
the others. A female servant ordered him away, but he told her he was
her master&rsquo;s nephew, and wanted to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>see him; whereupon she
smiled but let him pass into an inner court, where he found his uncle
sitting on the little veranda under the broad, overhanging eaves.</p>
<p>The man gruffly demanded, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am
your brother&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are starving at our
house, and have had no food for three days. My father is away now
trying to find work, but we are very hungry, and only ask you to loan
us a little rice till we can get some to return you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The uncle&rsquo;s eyes drew down to a point, his brows contracted,
and he seemed very angry, so that the nephew began looking for an easy
way of escape in case he should come at him. At last he looked up and
said: &ldquo;My rice is locked up, and I have ordered the granaries not
to be opened. The flour is sealed and cannot be broken into. If I give
you some cold victuals, the dogs will bark at you and try to take it
from you. If I give you the leavings of the wine-press, the pigs will
be jealous and squeal at you. If I give you bran, the cows and fowls
will take after you. Get out, and let me never see you here
again.&rdquo; So saying, he caught the poor boy by the collar and threw
him into the outer court, hurting him, and causing him to cry bitterly
with pain of body and distress of mind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>At home the poor mother sat jogging her babe in her weak arms, and
appeasing the other children by saying that brother had gone to their
uncle for food, and soon the pot would be boiling and they would all be
satisfied. When, hearing a foot-fall, all scrambled eagerly to the
door, only to see the empty-handed, red-eyed boy coming along, trying
manfully to look cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your uncle whip you?&rdquo; asked the mother, more eager
for the safety of her son, than to have her own crying want
allayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; stammered the brave boy. &ldquo;He had gone to the
capital on business,&rdquo; said he, hoping to thus prevent further
questioning, on so troublesome a subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do&rdquo;? queried the poor woman, amidst the
crying and moaning of her children. There was nothing to do but starve,
it seemed. However, she thought of her own straw shoes, which were
scarcely used, and these she sent to the market, where they brought
three <i>cash</i> (&#8203;3&frasl;15&#8203; of a cent). This pittance
was invested equally in rice, beans, and vegetables; eating which they
were relieved for the present, and with full stomachs the little ones
fell to playing happily once more, but the poor mother was full of
anxiety for the morrow.</p>
<p>Their fortune had turned, however, with their new lease of life, for
the father returned with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>bale of faggots he had gathered on
the mountains, and with the proceeds of these the shoes were redeemed
and more food was purchased. Bright and early then next morning both
parents went forth in search of work. The wife secured employment
winnowing rice. The husband overtook a boy bearing a pack, but his back
was so blistered, he could with difficulty carry his burden. Hyung Bo
adjusted the saddle of the pack frame to his own back, and carried it
for the boy, who, at their arrival at his destination in the evening,
gave his helper some cash, in addition to his lodging and meals. During
the night, however, a gentleman wished to send a letter by rapid
dispatch to a distant place, and Hyung Bo was paid well for carrying
it.</p>
<p>Returning from this profitable errand, he heard of a very rich man,
who had been seized by the corrupt local magistrate, on a false
accusation, and was to be beaten publicly, unless he consented to pay a
heavy sum as hush money. Hearing of this, Hyung went to see the rich
prisoner, and arranged with him that he would act as his substitute for
three thousand cash (two dollars). The man was very glad to get off so
easily, and Hyung took the beating. He limped to his house, where his
poor wife greeted him with tears and lamentations, for he was a sore
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>and sorry sight indeed. He was cheerful, however,
for he explained to them that this had been a rich day&rsquo;s work; he
had simply submitted to a little whipping, and was to get three
thousand cash for it.</p>
<p>The money did not come, however, for the fraud was detected, and the
original prisoner was also punished. Being of rather a close
disposition, the man seemed to think it unnecessary to pay for what did
him no good. Then the wife cried indeed over her husband&rsquo;s wrongs
and their own more unfortunate condition. But the husband cheered her,
saying: &ldquo;If we do right we will surely succeed.&rdquo; He was
right. Spring was coming on, and he soon got work at plowing and sowing
seed. They gave their little house the usual spring cleaning, and
decorated the door with appropriate legends, calling upon the fates to
bless with prosperity the little home.</p>
<p>With the spring came the birds from the south country, and they
seemed to have a preference for the home of this poor family&mdash;as
indeed did the rats and insects. The birds built their nests under the
eaves. They were swallows, and as they made their little mud
air-castles, Hyung Bo said to his wife: &ldquo;I am afraid to have
these birds build their nests there. Our house is so weak it may fall
down, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>and then what will the poor birds do?&rdquo; But
the little visitors seemed not alarmed, and remained with the kind
people, apparently feeling safe under the friendly roof.</p>
<p>By and by the little nests were full of commotion and bluster; the
eggs had opened, and circles of wide opened mouths could be seen in
every nest. Hyung and his children were greatly interested in this new
addition to their family circle, and often gave them bits of their own
scanty allowance of food, so that the birds became quite tame and
hopped in and out of the hut at will.</p>
<p>One day, when the little birds were taking their first lesson in
flying, Hyung was lying on his back on the ground, and saw a huge
roof-snake crawl along and devour several little birds before he could
arise and help them. One bird struggled from the reptile and fell, but,
catching both legs in the fine meshes of a reed-blind, they were
broken, and the little fellow hung helplessly within the snake&rsquo;s
reach. Hyung hastily snatched it down, and with the help of his wife he
bound up the broken limbs, using dried fish-skin for splints. He laid
the little patient in a warm place, and the bones speedily united, so
that the bird soon began to hop around the room, and pick up bits of
food laid out for him. Soon the splints were removed, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>however,
and he flew away, happily, to join his fellows.</p>
<p>The autumn came; and one evening&mdash;it was the ninth day of the
ninth moon&mdash;as the little family were sitting about the door, they
noticed the bird with the crooked legs sitting on the clothes-line and
singing to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he is thanking us and saying good-by,&rdquo; said
Hyung, &ldquo;for the birds are all going south now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That seemed to be the truth, for they saw their little friend no
longer, and they felt lonely without the occupants of the now deserted
nests. The birds, however, were paying homage to the king of birds in
the bird-land beyond the frosts. And as the king saw the little
crooked-legged bird come along, he demanded an explanation of the
strange sight. Thereupon the little fellow related his narrow escape
from a snake that had already devoured many of his brothers and
cousins, the accident in the blind, and his rescue and subsequent
treatment by a very poor but very kind man.</p>
<p>His bird majesty was very much entertained and pleased. He thereupon
gave the little cripple a seed engraved with fine characters in gold,
denoting that the seed belonged to the gourd family. This seed the bird
was to give to his benefactor in the spring. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>The winter wore away, and the spring found the little family almost
as destitute as when first we described them. One day they heard a
familiar bird song, and, running out, they saw their little
crooked-legged friend with something in its mouth, that looked like a
seed. Dropping its burden to the ground, the little bird sang to them
of the king&rsquo;s gratitude, and of the present he had sent, and then
flew away.</p>
<p>Hyung picked up the seed with curiosity, and on one side he saw the
name of its kind, on the other, in fine gold characters, was a message
saying: &ldquo;Bury me in soft earth, and give me plenty of
water.&rdquo; They did so, and in four days the little shoot appeared
in the fine earth. They watched its remarkable growth with eager
interest as the stem shot up, and climbed all over the house, covering
it up as a bower, and threatening to break down the frail structure
with the added weight. It blossomed, and soon four small gourds began
to form. They grew to an enormous size, and Hyung could scarcely keep
from cutting them. His wife prevailed on him to wait till the frost had
made them ripe, however, as then they could cut them, eat the inside,
and make water-vessels of the shells, which they could then sell, and
thus make a double profit. He waited, though with a poor grace, till
the ninth moon, when the gourds were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>left alone, high upon the
roof, with only a trace of the shrivelled stems which had planted them
there.</p>
<p>Hyung got a saw and sawed open the first huge gourd. He worked so
long, that when his task was finished he feared he must be in a swoon,
for out of the opened gourd stepped two beautiful boys, with fine
bottles of wine and a table of jade set with dainty cups. Hyung
staggered back and sought assurance of his wife, who was fully as dazed
as was her husband. The surprise was somewhat relieved by one of the
handsome youths stepping forth, placing the table before them, and
announcing that the bird king had sent them with these presents to the
benefactor of one of his subjects&mdash;the bird with broken legs. Ere
they could answer, the other youth placed a silver bottle on the table,
saying: &ldquo;This wine will restore life to the dead.&rdquo; Another,
which he placed on the table, would, he said, restore sight to the
blind. Then going to the gourd, he brought two gold bottles, one
contained a tobacco, which, being smoked, would give speech to the
dumb, while the other gold bottle contained wine, which would prevent
the approach of age and ward off death.</p>
<p>Having made these announcements, the pair disappeared, leaving Hyung
and his wife almost <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100"
name="pb100">100</a>]</span>dumb with amazement. They looked at the
gourd, then at the little table and its contents, and each looked at
the other to be sure it was not a dream. At length Hyung broke the
silence, remarking that, as he was very hungry, he would venture to
open another gourd, in the hope that it would be found full of
something good to eat, since it was not so important for him to have
something with which to restore life just now as it was to have
something to sustain life with.</p>
<p>The next gourd was opened as was the first, when by some means out
flowed all manner of household furniture, and clothing, with rolls upon
rolls of fine silk and satin cloth, linen goods, and the finest cotton.
The satin alone was far greater in bulk than the gourd had been, yet,
in addition, the premises were literally strewn with costly furniture
and the finest fabrics. They barely examined the goods now, their
amazement having become so great that they could scarcely wait until
all had been opened, and the whole seemed so unreal, that they feared
delay might be dangerous. Both sawed away on the next gourd, when out
came a body of carpenters, all equipped with tools and lumber, and, to
their utter and complete amazement, began putting up a house as quickly
and quietly as thought, so that before they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>could arise from the ground they saw a fine
house standing before them, with courts and servants' quarters,
stables, and granaries. Simultaneously a great train of bulls and
ponies appeared, loaded down with rice and other products as tributes
from the district in which the place was located. Others came bringing
money tribute, servants, male and female, and clothing.</p>
<p>They felt sure they were in dreamland now, and that they might enjoy
the exercise of power while it lasted, they began commanding the
servants to put the goods away, the money in the <i>sahrang</i>, or
reception-room, the clothing in the <i>tarack</i>, or garret over the
fireplace, the rice in the granaries, and animals in their stables.
Others were sent to prepare a bath, that they might don the fine
clothing before it should be too late. The servants obeyed, increasing
the astonishment of the pair, and causing them to literally forget the
fourth gourd in their amazed contemplation of the wondrous miracles
being performed, and the dreamy air of satisfaction and contentment
with which it surrounded them.</p>
<p>Their attention was called to the gourd by the servants, who were
then commanded to carefully saw it open. They did so, and out stepped a
maiden, as beautiful as were the gifts <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>that had preceded
her. Never before had Hyung looked on any one who could at all compare
with the matchless beauty and grace of the lovely creature who now
stood so modestly and confidingly before him. He could find no words to
express his boundless admiration, and could only stand in mute wonder
and feast himself upon her beauty. Not so with his wife, however. She
saw only a rival in the beautiful girl, and straightway demanded who
she was, whence she came, and what she wanted. The maid replied:
&ldquo;I am sent by the bird king to be this man&rsquo;s
concubine.&rdquo; Whereupon the wife grew dark in the face, and ordered
her to go whence she came and not see her husband again. She upbraided
him for not being content with a house and estate, numbers of retainers
and quantities of money, and declared this last trouble was all due to
his greed in opening the fourth gourd.</p>
<p>Her husband had by this time found his speech, however, and severely
reprimanding her for conducting herself in such a manner upon the
receipt of such heavenly gifts, while yesterday she had been little
more than a beggar; he commanded her to go at once to the women&rsquo;s
quarters, where she should reign supreme, and never make such a display
of her ill-temper again, under penalty of being consigned to a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>house by herself. The maiden he gladly welcomed,
and conducted her to apartments set aside for her.</p>

<p class="first">When Nahl Bo heard of the wonderful change taking
place at his brother&rsquo;s establishment, he went himself to look
into the matter. He found the report not exaggerated, and began to
upbraid his brother with dishonest methods, which accusation the
brother stoutly denied, and further demanded where, and of whom, he
could steal a house, such rich garments, fine furniture, and have it
removed in a day to the site of his former hovel. Nahl Bo demanded an
explanation, and Hyung Bo frankly told him how he had saved the bird
from the snake and had bound up its broken limbs, so that it recovered;
how the bird in return brought him a seed engraved with gold
characters, instructing him how to plant and rear it; and how, having
done so, the four gourds were born on the stalk, and from them, on
ripening, had appeared these rich gifts. The ill-favored brother even
then persisted in his charges, and in a gruff, ugly manner accused
Hyung Bo of being worse than a thief in keeping all these fine goods,
instead of dutifully sharing them with his elder brother. This
insinuation of undutiful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>conduct really annoyed Hyung Bo,
who, in his kindness of heart, forgave this unbrotherly senior, his
former ill conduct, and thinking only of his own present good fortune,
he kindly bestowed considerable gifts upon the undeserving brother, and
doubtless would have done more but that the covetous man espyed the
fair maiden, and at once insisted on having her. This was too much even
for the patient Hyung Bo, who refused with a determination remarkable
for him. A quarrel ensued, during which the elder brother took his
departure in a rage, fully determined to use the secret of his
brother&rsquo;s success for all it was worth in securing rich gifts for
himself.</p>
<p>Going home he struck at all the birds he could see, and ordered his
servants to do the same. After killing many, he succeeded in catching
one, and, breaking its legs, he took fish-skin and bound them up in
splints, laying the little sufferer in a warm place, till it recovered
and flew away, bandages and all. The result was as expected. The bird
being questioned by the bird king concerning its crooked legs, related
its story, dwelling, however, on the man&rsquo;s cruelty in killing so
many birds and then breaking its own legs. The king understood
thoroughly, and gave the little cripple a seed to present to the wicked
man on its return in the spring. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"
href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>Springtime came, and one day, as Nahl Bo was sitting cross-legged in
the little room opening on the veranda off his court, he heard a
familiar bird-song. Dropping his long pipe, he threw open the paper
windows, and there, sure enough, sat a crooked-legged bird on the
clothes line, bearing a seed in its mouth. Nahl Bo would let no one
touch it, but as the bird dropped the seed and flew away, he jumped out
so eagerly that he forgot to slip his shoes on, and got his clean white
stockings all befouled. He secured the seed, however, and felt that his
fortune was made. He planted it carefully, as directed, and gave it his
personal attention.</p>
<p>The vines were most luxurious. They grew with great rapidity, till
they had well nigh covered the whole of his large house and
out-buildings. Instead of one gourd, or even four, as in the
brother&rsquo;s case, the new vines bore twelve gourds, which grew and
grew till the great beams of his house fairly groaned under their
weight, and he had to block them in place to keep them from rolling off
the roofs. He had to hire men to guard them carefully, for now that the
source of Hyung Bo&rsquo;s riches was understood, every one was anxious
for a gourd. They did not know the secret, however, which Nahl Bo
concealed through selfishness, and Hyung through fear that every one
would take <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>to killing and maiming birds as his wicked
brother had done.</p>
<p>Maintaining a guard was expensive, and the plant so loosened the
roof tiles, by the tendrils searching for earth and moisture in the
great layer of clay under the tiles, that the rainy season made great
havoc with his house. Large portions of plaster from the inside fell
upon the paper ceilings, which in turn gave way, letting the dirty
water drip into the rooms, and making the house almost uninhabitable.
At last, however, the plants could do no more harm; the frost had come,
the vines had shrivelled away, and the enormous ripe gourds were
carefully lowered, amid the yelling of a score of coolies, as each
seemed to get in the others' way trying to manipulate the ropes and
poles with which the gourds were let down to the ground. Once inside
the court, and the great doors locked, Nahl Bo felt relieved, and
shutting out every one but a carpenter and his assistant, he prepared
for the great surprise which he knew must await him, in spite of his
most vivid dreams.</p>
<p>The carpenter insisted upon the enormous sum of 1,000 cash for
opening each gourd, and as he was too impatient to await the arrival of
another, and as he expected to be of princely wealth in a few moments,
Nahl Bo agreed to the exorbitant price. Whereupon, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>carefully bracing a gourd, the men began sawing
it through. It seemed a long time before the gourd fell in halves. When
it did, out came a party of rope-dancers, such as perform at fairs and
public places. Nahl Bo was unprepared for any such surprise as this,
and fancied it must be some great mistake. They sang and danced about
as well as the crowded condition of the court would allow, and the
family looked on complacently, supposing that the band had been sent to
celebrate their coming good fortune. But Nahl Bo soon had enough of
this. He wanted to get at his riches, and seeing that the actors were
about to stretch their ropes for a more extensive performance, he
ordered them to cease and take their departure. To his amazement,
however, they refused to do this, until he had paid them 5,000 cash for
their trouble. &ldquo;You sent for us and we came,&rdquo; said the
leader. &ldquo;Now pay us, or we will live with you till you do.&rdquo;
There was no help for it, and with great reluctance and some
foreboding, he gave them the money and dismissed them. Then Nahl Bo
turned to the carpenter, who chanced to be a man with an ugly visage,
made uglier by a great hare-lip. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are
the cause of all this. Before you entered this court these gourds were
filled with gold, and your ugly face has changed it to beggars.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>Number two was opened with no better results, for out came a body of
Buddhist priests, begging for their temple, and promising many sons in
return for offerings of suitable merit. Although disgusted beyond
measure, Nahl Bo still had faith in the gourds, and to get rid of the
priests, lest they should see his riches, he gave them also 5,000
cash.</p>
<p>As soon as the priests were gone, gourd number three was opened,
with still poorer results, for out came a procession of paid mourners
followed by a corpse borne by bearers. The mourners wept as loudly as
possible, and all was in a perfect uproar. When ordered to go, the
mourners declared they must have money for mourning, and to pay for
burying the body. Seeing no possible help for it, 5,000 cash was
finally given them, and they went out with the bier. Then Nahl
Bo&rsquo;s wife came into the court, and began to abuse the hare-lipped
man for bringing upon them all this trouble. Whereupon the latter
became angry and demanded his money that he might leave. They had no
intention of giving up the search as yet, however, and, as it was too
late to change carpenters, the ugly fellow was paid for the work
already done, and given an advance on that yet remaining. He therefore
set to work upon the fourth gourd, which Nahl Bo watched with feverish
anxiety. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>From this one there came a band of <i>gee sang</i>, or dancing
girls. There was one woman from each province, and each had her song
and dance. One sang of the <i>yang wang</i>, or wind god; another of
the <i>wang jay</i>, or pan deity; one sang of the <i>sung jee</i>, or
money that is placed as a christening on the roof tree of every house.
There was the cuckoo song. The song of the ancient tree that has lived
so long that its heart is dead and gone, leaving but a hollow space,
yet the leaves spring forth every spring-tide. The song of laughter and
mourning, with an injunction to see to it that the rice offering be
made to the departed spirits. To the king of the sun and stars a song
was sung. And last of all, one votary sang of the twelve months that
make the year, the twelve hours that make the day, the thirty days that
make the month, and of the new year&rsquo;s birth, as the old year
dies, taking with it their ills to be buried in the past, and reminding
all people to celebrate the New Year holidays by donning clean clothes
and feasting on good food, that the following year may be to them one
of plenty and prosperity. Having finished their songs and their
graceful posturing and waving of their gay silk banners, the <i>gee
sang</i> demanded their pay, which had to be given them, reducing the
family wealth 5,000 cash more. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110"
href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>The wife now tried to persuade Nahl Bo to stop and not open more,
but the hare-lip man offered to open the next for 500 cash, as he was
secretly enjoying the sport. So the fifth was opened a little, when a
yellow-looking substance was seen inside, which was taken to be gold,
and they hurriedly opened it completely. But instead of gold, out came
an acrobatic pair,&mdash;being a strong man with a youth dressed to
represent a girl. The man danced about, holding his young companion
balanced upon his shoulders, singing meanwhile a song of an ancient
king, whose riotous living was so distasteful to his subjects that he
built him a cavernous palace, the floor of which was covered with
quicksilver, the walls were decorated with jewels, and myriad lamps
turned the darkness into day. Here were to be found the choicest viands
and wines, with bands of music to entertain the feasters: most
beautiful women; and he enjoyed himself most luxuriously until his
enemy, learning the secret, threw open the cavern to the light of day,
when all of the beautiful women immediately disappeared in the
sun&rsquo;s rays.</p>
<p>Before he could get these people to discontinue their performance,
Nahl Bo had to give them also 5,000 cash. Yet in spite of all his ill
luck, he decided to open another. Which being done, a jester came
forth, demanding the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>expense money for his long journey. This
was finally given him, for Nahl Bo had hit upon what he deemed a clever
expedient. He took the wise fool aside, and asked him to use his wisdom
in pointing out to him which of these gourds contained gold. Whereupon
the jester looked wise, tapped several gourds, and motioned to each one
as being filled with gold.</p>
<p>The seventh was therefore opened, and a lot of yamen runners came
forth, followed by an official. Nahl Bo tried to run from what he knew
must mean an exorbitant &ldquo;squeeze,&rdquo; but he was caught and
beaten for his indiscretion. The official called for his valise, and
took from it a paper, which his secretary read, announcing that Nahl Bo
was the serf of this lord and must hereafter pay to him a heavy
tribute. At this they groaned in their hearts, and the wife declared
that even now the money was all gone, even to the last cash, while the
rabble which had collected had stolen nearly every thing worth
removing. Yet the officer&rsquo;s servants demanded pay for their
services, and they had to be given a note secured on the property
before they would leave. Matters were now so serious that they could
not be made much worse, and it was decided to open each remaining
gourd, that if there were any gold they might have it.</p>
<p>When the next one was opened a bevy of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span><i>moo tang</i> women
(soothsayers) came forth, offering to drive away the spirit of disease
and restore the sick to health. They arranged their banners for their
usual dancing ceremony, brought forth their drums, with which to
exorcise the demons, and called for rice to offer to the spirits and
clothes to burn for the spirits' apparel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; roared Nahl Bo. &ldquo;I am not sick except
for the visitation of such as yourselves, who are forever burdening the
poor, and demanding pay for your supposed services. Away with you, and
befool some other <i>pah sak ye</i> (eight month&rsquo;s
man&mdash;fool) if you can. I want none of your services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were no easier to drive away, however, than were the other
annoying visitors that had come with his supposed good fortune. He had
finally to pay them as he had the others; and dejectedly he sat,
scarcely noticing the opening of the ninth gourd.</p>
<p>The latter proved to contain a juggler, and the exasperated Nahl Bo,
seeing but one small man, determined to make short work of him. Seizing
him by his topknot of hair, he was about to drag him to the door, when
the dexterous fellow, catching his tormentor by the thighs, threw him
headlong over his own back, nearly breaking his neck, and causing him
to lie stunned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>for a time, while the expert bound him hand and
foot, and stood him on his head, so that the wife was glad to pay the
fellow and dismiss him ere the life should be departed from her
lord.</p>
<p>On opening the tenth a party of blind men came out, picking their
way with their long sticks, while their sightless orbs were raised
towards the unseen heavens. They offered to tell the fortunes of the
family. But, while their services might have been demanded earlier, the
case was now too desperate for any such help. The old men tinkled their
little bells, and chanted some poetry addressed to the four good
spirits stationed at the four corners of the earth, where they
patiently stand bearing the world upon their shoulders; and to the
distant heavens that arch over and fold the earth in their embrace,
where the two meet at the far horizon (as pictured in the Korean flag).
The blind men threw their dice, and, fearing lest they should prophesy
death, Nahl Bo quickly paid and dismissed them.</p>
<p>The next gourd was opened but a trifle, that they might first
determine as to the wisdom of letting out its contents. Before they
could determine, however, a voice like thunder was heard from within,
and the huge form of a giant arose, splitting open the gourd as he came
forth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>In his anger he seized poor Nahl Bo and tossed
him upon his shoulders as though he would carry him away. Whereupon the
wife plead with tears for his release, and gladly gave an order for the
amount of the ransom. After which the monster allowed the frightened
man to fall to the ground, nearly breaking his aching bones in the
fall.</p>
<p>The carpenter did not relish the sport any longer; it seemed to be
getting entirely too dangerous. He thereupon demanded the balance of
his pay, which they finally agreed to give him, providing he would open
the last remaining gourd. For the desperate people hoped to find this
at least in sufficient condition that they might cook or make soup of
it, since they had no food left at all and no money, while the other
gourds were so spoiled by the tramping of the feet of their unbidden
guests, as to be totally unfit for food.</p>
<p>The man did as requested, but had only sawed a very little when the
gourd split open as though it were rotten, while a most awful stench
arose, driving every one from the premises. This was followed by a gale
of wind, so severe as to destroy the buildings, which, in falling, took
fire from the <i>kang</i>, and while the once prosperous man looked on
in helpless misery, the last of his remaining property was swept
forever from him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115"

<p>The seed that had brought prosperity to his honest, deserving
brother had turned prosperity into ruin to the cruel, covetous Nahl Bo,
who now had to subsist upon the charity of his kind brother, whom he
had formerly treated so cruelly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"

<h2 class="main">CHUN YANG,</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE FAITHFUL DANCING-GIRL WIFE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the city of Nam Won, in Chull Lah Do (the southern
province of Korea), lived the Prefect Ye Tung Uhi. He was the happy
father of a son of some sixteen years of age. Being an only child the
boy was naturally much petted. He was not an ordinary young man,
however, for in addition to a handsome, manly face and stalwart figure,
he possessed a bright, quick mind, and was naturally clever. A more
dutiful son could not be found. He occupied a house in the rear of his
father&rsquo;s quarters, and devoted himself to his books, going
regularly each evening to make his obeisance to his father, and express
his wish that pleasant, refreshing sleep might come to him; then, in
the morning, before breakfasting, he was wont to go and enquire how the
new day had found his father.</p>
<p>The Prefect was but recently appointed to rule over the Nam Won
district when the events about to be recorded occurred. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>winter months had been spent mostly indoors, but
as the mild spring weather approached and the buds began to open to the
singing of the joyful birds, Ye Toh Ryung, or Toh Ryung, the son, felt
that he must get out and enjoy nature. Like an animal that has buried
itself in a hole in the earth, he came forth rejoicing; the bright
yellow birds welcomed him from the willow trees, the soft breezes
fanned his cheeks, and the freshness of the air exhilarated him. He
called his <i>pang san</i> (valet) and asked him concerning the
neighboring views. The servant was a native of the district, and knew
the place well; he enumerated the various places especially prized for
their scenery, but concluded with: &ldquo;But of all rare views,
&lsquo;Kang Hal Loo&rsquo; is the rarest. Officers from the eight
provinces come to enjoy the scenery, and the temple is covered with
verses they have left in praise of the place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,
then, we will go there,&rdquo; said Toh Ryung &ldquo;Go you and clean
up the place for my reception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant hurried off to order the temple swept and spread with
clean mats, while his young master sauntered along almost intoxicated
by the freshness and new life of every thing around him. Arrived at the
place, after a long, tedious ascent of the mountain side, he flung
himself upon a huge bolster-like cushion, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>and with half-closed
eyes, drank in the beauty of the scene along with the balmy,
perfume-laden spring zephyrs. He called his servant, and congratulated
him upon his taste, declaring that were the gods in search of a fine
view, they could not find a place that would surpass this; to which the
man answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true; so true, in fact, that it is well known that
the spirits do frequent this place for its beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, Toh Ryung had raised himself, and was leaning on
one arm, gazing out toward one side, when, as though it were one of the
spirits just mentioned, the vision of a beautiful girl shot up into the
air and soon fell back out of sight in the shrubbery of an adjoining
court-yard. He could just get a confused picture of an angelic face,
surrounded by hair like the black thunder-cloud, a neck of ravishing
beauty, and a dazzle of bright silks,&mdash;when the whole had
vanished. He was dumb with amazement, for he felt sure he must have
seen one of the spirits said to frequent the place; but before he could
speak, the vision arose again, and he then had time to see that it was
but a beautiful girl swinging in her dooryard. He did not move, he
scarcely breathed, but sat with bulging eyes absorbing the prettiest
view he had ever seen. He noted the handsome, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>laughing face, the silken black hair, held back
in a coil by a huge coral pin; he saw the jewels sparkling on the gay
robes, the dainty white hands and full round arms, from which the
breezes blew back the sleeves; and as she flew higher in her wild
sport, oh, joy! two little shoeless feet encased in white stockings,
shot up among the peach blossoms, causing them to fall in showers all
about her. In the midst of the sport her hairpin loosened and fell,
allowing her raven locks to float about her shoulders; but, alas! the
costly ornament fell on a rock and broke, for Toh Ryung could hear the
sharp click where he sat. This ended the sport, and the little maid
disappeared, all unconscious of the agitation she had caused in a young
man&rsquo;s breast by her harmless spring exercise.</p>
<p>After some silence, the young man asked his servant if he had seen
any thing, for even yet he feared his mind had been wandering close to
the dreamland. After some joking, the servant confessed to having seen
the girl swinging, whereupon his master demanded her name. &ldquo;She
is Uhl Mahs' daughter, a <i>gee sang</i> (public dancing girl) of this
city; her name is Chun Yang Ye&rdquo;&mdash;fragrant spring.
&ldquo;<i>I yah!</i> superb; I can see her then, and have her sing and
dance for me,&rdquo; exclaimed Toh Ryung. &ldquo;Go and call her at
once, you slave.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=
"#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>The man ran, over good road and bad alike, up hill and down, panting
as he went; for while the back of the women&rsquo;s quarters of the
adjoining compound was near at hand, the entrance had to be reached by
a long circuit. Arriving out of breath, he pounded at the gate, calling
the girl by name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that calls me?&rdquo; she enquired when the noise had
attracted her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind who,&rdquo; answered the exhausted man,
&ldquo;it is great business; open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, and what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am nobody, and I want nothing; but Ye Toh Ryung is the
Governor&rsquo;s son, and he wants to see the Fragrant
Spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told Ye Toh Ryung my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind who told him; if you did not want him to know you,
then why did you swing so publicly? The great man&rsquo;s son came here
to rest and see the beautiful views; he saw you swinging, and can see
nothing since. You must go, but you need not fear. He is a gentleman,
and will treat you nicely; if your dancing pleases him as did your
swinging, he may present you with rich gifts, for he is his
father&rsquo;s only son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regretting in her proud spirit that fates had placed her in a
profession where she was expected <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"
href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>to entertain the nobility
whether it suited her or not, the girl combed and arranged her hair,
tightened her sash, smoothed her disordered clothes, and prepared to
look as any vain woman would wish who was about to be presented to the
handsomest and most gifted young nobleman of the province. She followed
the servant slowly till they reached Toh Ryung&rsquo;s stopping place.
She waited while the servant announced her arrival, for a gee sang must
not enter a nobleman&rsquo;s presence unbidden. Toh Ryung was too
excited to invite her in, however, and his servant had to prompt him,
when, laughing at his own agitation, he pleasantly bade her enter and
sit down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Chun Yang Ye,&rdquo; she said, with a voice that
resembled silver jingling in a pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My age is just twice eight years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; laughed the now composed boy, &ldquo;how
fortunate; you are twice eight, and I am four fours. We are of the same
age. Your name, Fragrant Spring, is the same as your face&mdash;very
beautiful. Your cheeks are like the petals of the <i>mah hah</i> that
ushers in the soft spring. Your eyes are like those of the eagle
sitting on the ancient tree, but soft and gentle as the
moonlight,&rdquo; ran on the enraptured youth. &ldquo;When is your
birthday?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My birthday occurs at midnight on the eighth day of the
fourth moon,&rdquo; modestly replied the flattered girl, who was
quickly succumbing to the charms of the ardent and handsome young
fellow, whose heart she could see was already her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; exclaimed he; &ldquo;that is the date
of the lantern festival, and it is also my own birthday, only I was
born at eleven instead of twelve. I am sorry I was not born at twelve
now. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Surely the gods had some motive in
sending us into the world at the same time, and thus bringing us
together at our sixteenth spring-tide. Heaven must have intended us to
be man and wife&rdquo;; and he bade her sit still as she started as
though to take her departure. Then he began to plead with her, pacing
the room in his excitement, till his attendant likened the sound to the
combat of ancient warriors. &ldquo;This chance meeting of ours has a
meaning,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;Often when the buds were bursting, or
when the forest trees were turning to fire and blood, have I played and
supped with pretty gee sang, watched them dance, and wrote them verses,
but never before have I lost my heart; never before have I seen any one
so incomparably beautiful. You are no common mortal. You were destined
to be my wife; you must be mine, you must marry me.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>She wrinkled her fair brow and thought, for she was no silly,
foolish thing, and while her heart was almost, if not quite won by this
tempestuous lover, yet she saw where his blind love would not let him
see. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the son of a nobleman may
not marry a gee sang without the consent of his parents. I know I am a
gee sang by name, the fates have so ordained, but, nevertheless, I am
an honorable woman, always have been, and expect to remain
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;we cannot celebrate the
&lsquo;six customs ceremony&rsquo; (parental arrangements, exchange of
letters, contracts, exchange of presents, preliminary visits, ceremony
proper), but we can be privately married just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it cannot be. Your father would not consent, and should
we be privately married, and your father be ordered to duty at some
other place, you would not dare take me with you. Then you would marry
the daughter of some nobleman, and I would be forgotten. It must not,
cannot be,&rdquo; and she arose to depart. &ldquo;Stay, stay,&rdquo; he
begged. &ldquo;You do me an injustice. I will never forsake you, or
marry another. I swear it. And a <i>yang ban</i> (noble) has but one
mouth, he cannot speak two ways. Even should we leave this place I will
take you with me, or return soon to you. You must not refuse me.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose you change your mind or forget your promises;
words fly out of the mouth and are soon lost, ink and paper are more
lasting; give me your promises in writing,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Instantly the young man took up paper and brush; having rubbed the
ink well, he wrote: &ldquo;A memorandum. Desiring to enjoy the spring
scenery, I came to Kang Hal Loo. There I saw for the first time my
heaven-sent bride. Meeting for the first time, I pledge myself for one
hundred years; to be her faithful husband. Should I change, show this
paper to the magistrate.&rdquo; Folding up the manuscript with care he
handed it to her. While putting it into her pocket she said:
&ldquo;Speech has no legs, yet it can travel many thousands of miles.
Suppose this matter should reach your father&rsquo;s ears, what would
you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear; my father was once young, who knows but I may be
following the example of his early days. I have contracted with you,
and we now are married, even my father cannot change it. Should he
discover our alliance and disown me, I will still be yours, and
together we shall live and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She arose to go, and pointing with her jade-like hand to a clump of
bamboos, said: &ldquo;There is my house; as I cannot come to you, you
must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>come to me and make my mother&rsquo;s house your
home, as much as your duty to your parents will allow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the sun began to burn red above the mountains' peaks, they bade
each other a fond adieu, and each departed for home accompanied by
their respective attendants.</p>
<p>Ye Toh Ryung went to his room, which now seemed a prison-like place
instead of the pleasant study he had found it. He took up a book, but
reading was no satisfaction, every word seemed to transform itself into
Chun or Yang. Every thought was of the little maid of the spring
fragrance. He changed his books, but it was no use, he could not even
keep them right side up, not to mention using them properly. Instead of
singing off his lessons as usual, he kept singing, <i>Chun Yang Ye poh
go sip so</i> (I want to see the spring fragrance), till his father,
hearing the confused sounds, sent to ascertain what was the matter with
his son. The boy was singing, &ldquo;As the parched earth cries for
rain after the seven years' drought, so my heart pants for my Chun Yang
Ye, whose face to me is like the rays of the sun upon the earth after a
nine years' rain.&rdquo; He paid no heed to the servants, and soon his
father sent his private secretary, demanding what it was the boy
desired so much that he should keep singing. &ldquo;I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>want
to see, I want to see.&rdquo; Toh Ryung answered that he was reading an
uninteresting book, and looking for another. Though he remained more
quiet after this, he still was all impatience to be off to his
sweetheart-wife, and calling his attendant, he sent him out to see how
near the sun was to setting. Enjoying the sport, the man returned,
saying the sun was now high over head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begone,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can any one hold back the sun;
it had reached the mountain tops before I came home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the servant brought his dinner, for which he had no
appetite. He could ill abide the long delay between the dinner hour and
the regular time for his father&rsquo;s retiring. The time did come,
however, and when the lights were extinguished and his father had gone
to sleep, he took his trusty servant, and, scaling the back wall, they
hurried to the house of Chun Yang Ye.</p>
<p>As they approached they heard someone playing the harp, and singing
of the &ldquo;dull pace of the hours when one&rsquo;s lover is
away.&rdquo; Being admitted, they met the mother, who, with some
distrust, received Toh Ryung&rsquo;s assurances and sent him to her
daughter&rsquo;s apartments.</p>
<p>The house pleased him; it was neat and well-appointed. The public
room, facing the court, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>was lighted by a blue lantern,
which in the mellow light resembled a pleasure barge drifting on the
spring flood. Banners of poetry hung upon the walls. Upon the door
leading to Chun Yang&rsquo;s little parlor hung a banner inscribed with
verses to her ancestors and descendants, praying that &ldquo;a century
be short to span her life and happiness, and that her children&rsquo;s
children be blessed with prosperity for a thousand years.&rdquo;
Through the open windows could be seen moonlight glimpses of the little
garden of the swinging girl. There was a miniature lake almost filled
with lotus plants, where two sleepy swans floated with heads beneath
their wings, while the occasional gleam of a gold or silver scale
showed that the water was inhabited. A summer-house on the
water&rsquo;s edge was almost covered with fragrant spring blossoms,
the whole being enclosed in a little grove of bamboo and willows, that
shut out the view of outsiders.</p>
<p>While gazing at this restful sight, Chun Yang Ye herself came out,
and all was lost in the lustre of her greater beauty. She asked him
into her little parlor, where was a profusion of choice carved cabinets
and ornaments of jade and metal, while richly embroidered mats covered
the highly-polished floor. She was so delighted that she took both his
hands in her pretty, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128"
name="pb128">128</a>]</span>white, soft ones, and gazing longingly into
each other&rsquo;s eyes, she led him into another room, where, on a low
table, a most elegant lunch was spread. They sat down on the floor and
surveyed the loaded table. There were fruits preserved in sugar,
candied nuts arranged in many dainty, nested boxes; sweet pickles and
confections, pears that had grown in the warmth of a summer now dead,
and grapes that had been saved from decay by the same sun that had
called them forth. Quaint old bottles with long, twisted necks,
contained choice medicated wines, to be drunk from the little crackled
cups, such as the ancients used.</p>
<p>Pouring out a cup, she sang to him: &ldquo;This is the elixir of
youth; drinking this, may you never grow old; though ten thousand years
pass over your head, may you stand like the mountain that never
changes.&rdquo; He drank half of the cup&rsquo;s contents, and praised
her sweet voice, asking for another song. She sang: &ldquo;Let us drain
the cup while we may. In the grave who will be our cup-bearer. While we
are young let us play. When old, mirth gives place to care. The flowers
can bloom but a few days at best, and must then die, that the seed may
be born. The moon is no sooner full than it begins to wane, that the
young moon may rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentiments suited him, the wine exhilarated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>him,
and his spirits rose. He drained his cup, and called for more wine and
song; but she restrained him. They ate the dainty food, and more wine
and song followed. She talked of the sweet contract they had made, and
anon they pledged themselves anew. Not content with promises for this
short life, they went into the future, and he yielded readily to her
request, that when death should at last o&rsquo;ertake them, she would
enter a flower, while he would become a butterfly, coming and resting
on her bosom, and feasting off her fragrant sweetness.</p>
<p>The father did not know of his son&rsquo;s recent alliance, though
the young man honestly went and removed Chun Yang&rsquo;s name from the
list of the district gee sang, kept in his father&rsquo;s office; for,
now that she was a married woman, she need no longer go out with the
dancing-girls. Every morning, as before, the dutiful son presented
himself before his father, with respectful inquiries after his health,
and his rest the preceding night. But, nevertheless, each night the
young man&rsquo;s apartments were deserted, while he spent the time in
the house of his wife.</p>
<p>Thus the months rolled on with amazing speed. The lovers were in
paradise. The father enjoyed his work, and labored hard for the
betterment of the condition of his subjects. Never before had so large
a tribute been sent by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>this district. Yet the people were
not burdened as much as when far less of their products reached the
government granaries. The honest integrity of the officer reached the
King in many reports, and when a vacancy occurred at the head of the
Treasury Department, he was raised to be Ho Joh Pansa (Secretary of
Finance). Delighted, the father sent for his son and told him the news,
but, to his amazement, the young man had naught to say, in fact he
seemed as one struck dumb, as well he might. Within himself there was a
great tumult; his heart beat so violently as to seem perceptible, and
at times it arose and filled his throat, cutting off any speech he
might wish to utter. Surprised at the conduct of his son, the father
bade him go and inform his mother, that she might order the packing to
commence.</p>
<p>He went; but soon found a chance to fly to Chun Yang, who, at first,
was much concerned for his health, as his looks denoted a serious
illness. When he had made her understand, however, despair seized her,
and they gazed at each other in mute dismay and utter helplessness. At
last she seemed to awaken from her stupor, and, in an agony of despair,
she beat her breast, and moaned: &ldquo;Oh, how can we separate. We
must die, we cannot live apart&rdquo;; and tears coming to her relief,
she cried: &ldquo;If we say good-by, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>it will be forever;
we can never meet again. Oh, I feared it; we have been too
happy&mdash;too happy. The one who made this order is a murderer; it
must be my death. If you go to Seoul and leave me, I must die. I am but
a poor weak woman, and I cannot live without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her, and laying her head on his breast, tried to soothe her.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry so bitterly,&rdquo; he begged; &ldquo;my heart
is almost broken now. I cannot bear it. I wish it could always be
spring-time; but this is only like the cruel winter that, lingering in
the mountain, sometimes sweeps down the valley, drives out the spring,
and kills the blossoms. We will not give up and die, though. We have
contracted for one hundred years, and this will be but a bitter
separation that will make our speedy reunion more blissful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;but how can I live here alone,
with you in Seoul? Just think of the long, tedious summer days, the
long and lonely winter nights. I must see no one. I cannot know of you,
for who will tell me, and how am I to endure it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had not my father been given this great honor, we would
perhaps not have been parted; as it is I must go, there is no help for
it, but you must believe me when I promise I will <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>come
again. Here, take this crystal mirror as a pledge that I will keep my
word&rdquo;; and he gave her his pocket-mirror of rock crystal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me when you will return,&rdquo; said she; and then,
without awaiting an answer, she sang: &ldquo;When the sear and withered
trunk begins to bloom, and the dead bird sings in the branches, then my
lover will come to me. When the river flows over the eastern mountains,
then may I see him glide along in his ship to me.&rdquo; He chided her
for her lack of faith, and assured her again it was as hard for one as
the other. After a time she became more reconciled, and taking off her
jade ring, gave it to him for a keepsake, saying: &ldquo;My love, like
this ring, knows no end. You must go, alas! but my love will go with
you, and may it protect you when crossing wild mountains and distant
rivers, and bring you again safely to me. If you go to Seoul, you must
not trifle, but take your books, study hard, and enter the
examinations, then, perhaps, you may obtain rank and come to me. I will
stand with my hand shading my eyes, ever watching for your
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Promising to cherish her speech, with her image in his breast, they
made their final adieu, and tore apart.</p>
<p>The long journey seemed like a funeral to the lover. Everywhere her
image rose before him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>He could think of nothing else;
but by the time he arrived at the capital he had made up his mind as to
his future course, and from that day forth his parents wondered at his
stern, determined manner. He shut himself up in his room with his
books. He would neither go out, or form acquaintances among the young
noblemen of the gay city. Thus he spent months in hard study, taking no
note of passing events.</p>
<p>In the meantime a new magistrate came to Nam Won. He was a
hard-faced, hard-hearted politician. He associated with the dissolute,
and devoted himself to riotous living, instead of caring for the
welfare of the people. He had not been long in the place till he had
heard so much of the matchless beauty of Chun Yang Ye that he
determined to see, and if, as reported, marry her. Accordingly he
called the clerk of the yamen, and asked concerning &ldquo;the
beautiful gee sang Chun Yang Ye.&rdquo; The clerk answered that such a
name had appeared on the records of the dancing girls, but that it had
been removed, as she had contracted a marriage with the son of the
previous magistrate, and was now a lady of position and
respectability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lying rascal!&rdquo; yelled the enraged officer, who
could ill brook any interference with plans he had formed. &ldquo;A
nobleman&rsquo;s son cannot really marry a dancing girl; leave my
presence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>at once, and summon this remarkable
&lsquo;lady&rsquo; to appear before me.&rdquo; The clerk could only do
as he was bidden, and, summoning the yamen runners, he sent to the
house of Chun Yang Ye to acquaint her with the official order.</p>
<p>The runners, being natives of the locality, were loath to do as
commanded, and when the fair young woman gave them &ldquo;wine
money&rdquo; they willingly agreed to report her &ldquo;too sick to
attend the court.&rdquo; Upon doing so, however, the wrath of their
master came down upon them. They were well beaten, and then commanded
to go with a chair and bring the woman, sick or well, while if they
disobeyed him a second time they would be put to death.</p>
<p>Of course they went, but after they had explained to Chun Yang Ye
their treatment, her beauty and concern for their safety so affected
them, that they offered to go back without her, and face their doom.
She would not hear to their being sacrificed for her sake, and prepared
to accompany them. She disordered her hair, soiled her fair face, and
clad herself in dingy, ill-fitting gowns, which, however, seemed only
to cause her natural beauty the more to shine forth. She wept bitterly
on entering the yamen, which fired the anger of the official. He
ordered her to stop her crying or be beaten, and then as he looked at
her disordered and tear-stained face, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>that resembled choice
jade spattered with mud, he found that her beauty was not
overstated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does your conduct mean?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why have
you not presented yourself at this office with the other gee
sang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, though born a gee sang, I am by marriage a lady, and
not subject to the rules of my former profession,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; roared the Prefect. &ldquo;No more of this
nonsense. Present yourself here with the other gee sang, or pay the
penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&rdquo; she bravely cried. &ldquo;A thousand deaths
first. You have no right to exact such a thing of me. You are the
King&rsquo;s servant, and should see that the laws are executed, rather
than violated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was fairly beside himself with wrath at this, and ordered
her chained and thrown into prison at once. The people all wept with
her, which but increased her oppressor&rsquo;s anger, and calling the
jailer he ordered him to treat her with especial rigor, and be extra
vigilant lest some sympathizers should assist her to escape. The jailer
promised, but nevertheless he made things as easy for her as was
possible under the circumstances. Her mother came and moaned over her
daughter&rsquo;s condition, declaring that she was foolish in clinging
to her faithless husband, who had brought all this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>trouble upon them. The neighbors, however,
upbraided the old woman for her words, and assured the daughter that
she had done just right, and would yet be rewarded. They brought
presents of food, and endeavored to make her condition slightly less
miserable by their attentions.</p>
<p>She passed the night in bowing before Heaven and calling on the gods
and her husband to release her, and in the morning when her mother
came, she answered the latter&rsquo;s inquiries as to whether she was
alive or not, in a feeble voice which alarmed her parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am still alive, but surely dying. I can never see my Toh
Ryung again; but when I am dead you must take my body to Seoul and bury
it near the road over which he travels the most, that even in death I
may be near him, though separated in life.&rdquo; Again the mother
scolded her for her devotion and for making the contract that binds her
strongly to such a man. She could stand it no longer, and begged her
mother that she would go away and come to see her no more if she had no
pleasanter speech than such to make. &ldquo;I followed the dictates of
my heart and my mind. I did what was right. Can I foretell the future?
Because the sun shines to-day are we assured that to-morrow it will
shine? The deed is done. I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>do not regret it; leave me to my
grief, but do not add to it by your unkindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the days lengthened into months, but she seemed like one dead,
and took no thought of time or its flight. She was really ill, and
would have died but for the kindness of the jailer. At last one night
she dreamed that she was in her own room, dressing, and using the
little mirror Toh Ryung had given her, when, without apparent cause, it
suddenly broke in halves. She awoke, startled, and felt sure that death
was now to liberate her from her sorrows, for what other meaning could
the strange occurrence have than that her body was thus to be broken.
Although anxious to die and be free, she could not bear the thought of
leaving this world without a last look at her loved husband whose hands
alone could close her eyes when her spirit had departed. Pondering much
upon the dream, she called the jailer and asked him to summon a blind
man, as she wished her fortune told. The jailer did so. It was no
trouble, for almost as she spoke they heard one picking his way along
the street with his long stick, and uttering his peculiar call. He came
in and sat down, when they soon discovered that they were friends, for
before the man became blind he had been in comfortable circumstances,
and had known her father intimately. She therefore asked him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>to be to her as a kind father, and faithfully
tell her when and how death would come to her. He said: &ldquo;When the
blossoms fade and fall they do not die, their life simply enters the
seed to bloom again. Death to you would but liberate your spirit to
shine again in a fairer body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thanked him for his kind generalities, but was impatient, and
telling her dream, she begged a careful interpretation of it. He
promptly answered, that to be an ill omen a mirror in breaking must
make a noise. And on further questioning, he found that in her dream a
bird had flown into the room just as the mirror was breaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The bird was bearer of good
news, and the breaking of the mirror, which Toh Ryung gave you,
indicates that the news concerned him; let us see.&rdquo; Thereupon he
arranged a bunch of sticks, shook them well, while uttering his chant,
and threw them upon the floor. Then he soon answered that the news was
good. &ldquo;Your husband has done well. He has passed his
examinations, been promoted, and will soon come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was too happy to believe it, thinking the old man had made it up
to please his old friend&rsquo;s distressed child. Yet she cherished
the dream and the interpretation in her breast, finding in it solace to
her weary, troubled heart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the meantime Ye Toh Ryung had continued his studious work day and
night, to the anxiety of his parents. Just as he began to feel well
prepared for the contest he awaited, a royal proclamation announced,
that owing to the fact that peace reigned throughout the whole country,
that the closing year had been one of prosperity, and no national
calamity had befallen the country, His Gracious Majesty had ordered a
grand <i>guaga</i>, or competitive examination, to be held. As soon as
it became known, literary pilgrims began to pour in from all parts of
the country, bent on improving their condition.</p>
<p>The day of the examination found a vast host seated on the grass in
front of the pavilion where His Majesty and his officers were. Ye Toh
Ryung was given as a subject for his composition, &ldquo;A lad playing
in the shade of a pine tree is <span class="corr" id="xd25e1339" title=
"Source: qustioned">questioned</span> by an aged wayfarer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man long rubbed his ink-stick on the stone, thinking very
intently meanwhile, but when he began to write in the beautiful
characters for which he was noted he seemed inspired, and the
composition rolled forth as though he had committed it from the ancient
classics. He made the boy express such sentiments of reverence to age
as would have charmed the ancients, and the wisdom he put into the
conversation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>was worthy of a king. The matter came so freely
that his task was soon finished; in fact many were still wrinkling
their brows in preliminary thought, while he was carefully folding up
his paper, concealing his name so that the author should not be
recognized till the paper had been judged on its merits. He tossed his
composition into the pen, and it was at once inspected, being the first
one, and remarkably quickly done. When His Majesty heard it read, and
saw the perfect characters, he was astonished. Such excellence in
writing, composition, and sentiment was unparalleled, and before any
other papers were received it was known that none could excel this one.
The writer&rsquo;s name was ascertained, and the King was delighted to
learn that &lsquo;twas the son of his favorite officer. The young man
was sent for, and received the congratulations of his King. The latter
gave him the usual three glasses of wine, which he drank with modesty.
He was then given a wreath of flowers from the King&rsquo;s own hands;
the court hat was presented to him, with lateral wings, denoting the
rapidity&mdash;as the flight of a bird&mdash;with which he must execute
his Sovereign&rsquo;s commands. Richly embroidered breast-plates were
given him, to be worn over the front and back of his court robes. He
then went forth, riding on a gayly caparisoned horse, preceded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>by a band of palace musicians and attendants.
Everywhere he was greeted with the cheers of the populace, as for three
days he devoted his time to this public display. This duty having been
fulfilled, he devotedly went to the graves of his ancestors, and
prostrated himself with offerings before them, bemoaning the fact that
they could not be present to rejoice in his success. He then presented
himself before his King, humbly thanking him for his gracious
condescension in bestowing such great honors upon one so utterly
unworthy.</p>
<p>His Sovereign was pleased, and told the young man to strive to
imitate the example of his honest father. He then asked him what
position he wished. Ye Toh Ryung answered that he wished no other
position than one that would enable him to be of service to his King.
&ldquo;The year has been one of great prosperity,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;The plentiful harvest will tempt corrupt men to oppress the
people to their own advantage. I would like, therefore, should it meet
with Your Majesty&rsquo;s approval, to undertake the <span class="corr"
id="xd25e1351" title="Source: ardous">arduous</span> duties of
<i>Ussa</i>&rdquo;&mdash;government inspector.</p>
<p>He said this as he knew he would then be free to go in search of his
wife, while he could also do much good at the same time. The King was
delighted, and had his appointment&mdash;a private one
naturally&mdash;made at once, giving him the peculiar seal of the
office. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>The new Ussa disguised himself as a beggar, putting on straw
sandals, a broken hat, underneath which his hair, uncombed and without
the encircling band to hold it in place, streamed out in all
directions. He wore no white strip in the neck of his shabby gown, and
with dirty face he certainly presented a beggarly appearance.
Presenting himself at the stables outside of the city, where horses and
attendants are provided for the ussas, he soon arranged matters by
showing his seal, and with proper attendants started on his journey
towards his former home in the southern province.</p>
<p>Arriving at his destination, he remained outside in a miserable
hamlet while his servants went into the city to investigate the people
and learn the news.</p>
<p>It was spring-time again. The buds were bursting, the birds were
singing, and in the warm valley a band of farmers were plowing with
lazy bulls, and singing, meanwhile, a grateful song in praise of their
just King, their peaceful, prosperous country, and their full stomachs.
As the Ussa came along in his disguise he began to jest with them, but
they did not like him, and were rude in their jokes at his expense;
when an old man, evidently the father, cautioned them to be careful.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this man&rsquo;s
speech is only half made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>up of our common talk; he is
playing a part. I think he must be a gentleman in disguise.&rdquo; The
Ussa drew the old man into conversation, asking about various local
events, and finally questioning him concerning the character of the
Prefect. &ldquo;Is he just or oppressive, drunken or sober? Does he
devote himself to his duties, or give himself up to riotous
living?&rdquo; &ldquo;Our Magistrate we know little of. His heart is as
hard and unbending as the dead heart of the ancient oak. He cares not
for the people; the people care not for him but to avoid him. He
extorts rice and money unjustly, and spends his ill-gotten gains in
riotous living. He has imprisoned and beaten the fair Chun Yang Ye
because she repulsed him, and she now lies near to death in the prison,
because she married and is true to the poor dog of a son of our former
just magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ye Toh Ryung was stung by these unjust remarks, filled with the
deepest anxiety for his wife, and the bitterest resentment toward the
brute of an official, whom, he promised himself, soon to bring to
justice. As he moved away, too full of emotion for further
conversation, he heard the farmers singing, &ldquo;Why are some men
born to riches, others born to toil, some to marry and live in peace,
others too poor to possess a hut.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>He walked away meditating. He had placed himself down on the
people&rsquo;s level, and began to feel with them. Thus meditating he
crossed a valley, through which a cheery mountain brook rushed merrily
along. Near its banks, in front of a poor hut, sat an aged man twisting
twine. Accosting him, the old man paid no attention; he repeated his
salutation, when the old man, surveying him from head to foot, said:
&ldquo;In the government service age does not count for much, there
rank is every thing; an aged man may have to bow to a younger, who is
his superior officer. &rsquo;Tis not so in the country, however; here
age alone is respected. Then why am I addressed thus by such a
miserable looking stripling?&rdquo; The young man asked his
elder&rsquo;s pardon, and then requested him to answer a question.
&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that the new Magistrate is about
to marry the gee sang, Chun Yang Ye; is it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention her name,&rdquo; said the old man,
angrily. &ldquo;You are not worthy to speak of her. She is dying in
prison, because of her loyal devotion to the brute beast who married
and deserted her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ye Toh Ryung could hear no more. He hurried from the place, and
finding his attendants, announced his intention of going at once into
the city, lest the officials should hear of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>presence and prepare for him. Entering the city,
he went direct to Chun Yang Ye&rsquo;s house. It presented little of
the former pleasant appearance. Most of the rich furniture had been
sold to buy comforts for the imprisoned girl. The mother, seeing him
come, and supposing him to be a beggar, almost shrieked at him to get
away. &ldquo;Are you such a stranger, that you don&rsquo;t know the
news? My only child is imprisoned, my husband long since dead, my
property almost gone, and you come to me for alms. Begone, and learn
the news of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Don&rsquo;t you know me? I am Ye Toh Ryung, your
son-in-law,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye Toh Ryung, and a beggar! Oh, it cannot be. Our only hope
is in you, and now you are worse than helpless. My poor girl will
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with her?&rdquo; said he, pretending.</p>
<p>The woman related the history of the past months in full, not
sparing the man in the least, giving him such a rating as only a woman
can. He then asked to be taken to the prison, and she accompanied him
with a strange feeling of gratification in her heart that after all she
was right, and her daughter&rsquo;s confidence was ill-placed. Arriving
at the prison, the mother expressed her feelings by calling to her
daughter: &ldquo;Here is your wonderful husband. You have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>been
so anxious to simply see Ye Toh Ryung before you die; here he is; look
at the beggar, and see what your devotion amounts to! Curse him and
send him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ussa called to her, and she recognized the voice. &ldquo;I
surely must be dreaming again,&rdquo; she said, as she tried to arise;
but she had the huge neck-encircling board upon her shoulders that
marked the latest of her tormentor&rsquo;s acts of oppression, and
could not get up. Stung by the pain and the calmness of her
lover&rsquo;s voice, she sarcastically asked: &ldquo;Why have you not
come to me? Have you been so busy in official life? Have the rivers
been so deep and rapid that you dared not cross them? Did you go so far
away that it has required all this time to retrace your steps?&rdquo;
And then, regretting her harsh words, she said: &ldquo;I cannot tell my
rapture. I had expected to have to go to Heaven to meet you, and now
you are here. Get them to unbind my feet, and remove this yoke from my
neck, that I may come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came to the little window through which food is passed, and
looked upon her. As she saw his face and garb, she moaned: &ldquo;Oh,
what have we done to be so afflicted? You cannot help me now; we must
die. Heaven has deserted us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;granting I am poor,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>yet should we not be happy in our reunion. I
have come as I promised, and we will yet be happy. Do yourself no
injury, but trust to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She called her mother, who sneeringly inquired of what service she
could be, now that the longed-for husband had returned in answer to her
prayers. She paid no attention to these cruel words, but told her
mother of certain jewels she had concealed in a case in her room.
&ldquo;Sell these,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and buy some food and
raiment for my husband; take him home and care for him well. Have him
sleep on my couch, and do not reproach him for what he cannot
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went with the old woman, but soon left to confer with his
attendants, who informed him that the next day was the birthday of the
Magistrate, and that great preparations were being made for the
celebration that would commence early. A great feast, when wine would
flow like water, was to take place in the morning. The gee sang from
the whole district were to perform for the assembled guests; bands of
music were practising for the occasion, and the whole bade fair to be a
great, riotous debauch, which would afford the Ussa just the
opportunity the consummation of his plans awaited.</p>
<p>Early the next morning the disguised Ussa presented himself at the
yamen gate, where the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>servants jeered at him, telling
him: &ldquo;This is no beggars' feast,&rdquo; and driving him away. He
hung around the street, however, listening to the music inside, and
finally he made another attempt, which was more successful than the
first, for the servants, thinking him crazy, tried to restrain him,
when, in the mel&eacute;e, he made a passage and rushed through the
inner gate into the court off the reception hall. The annoyed host, red
with wine, ordered him at once ejected and the gate men whipped. His
order was promptly obeyed, but Ye did not leave the place. He found a
break in the outside wall, through which he climbed, and again
presented himself before the feasters. While the Prefect was too blind
with rage to be able to speak, the stranger said: &ldquo;I am a beggar,
give me food and drink that I, too, may enjoy myself.&rdquo; The guests
laughed at the man&rsquo;s presumption, and thinking him crazy, they
urged their host to humor him for their entertainment. To which he
finally consented, and, sending him some food and wine, bade him stay
in a corner and eat.</p>
<p>To the surprise of all, the fellow seemed still discontented, for he
claimed that, as the other guests each had a fair gee sang to sing a
wine song while they drank, he should be treated likewise. This amused
the guests immensely, and they got the master to send one. The girl
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>went with a poor grace, however, saying:
&ldquo;One would think from the looks of you that your poor throat
would open to the wine without a song to oil it,&rdquo; and sang him a
song that wished him speedy death instead of long life.</p>
<p>After submitting to their taunts for some time, he said, &ldquo;I
thank you for your food and wine and the graciousness of my reception,
in return for which I will amuse you by writing you some verses&rdquo;;
and, taking pencil and paper, he wrote: &ldquo;The oil that enriches
the food of the official is but the life blood of the down-trodden
people, whose tears are of no more merit in the eyes of the oppressor
than the drippings of a burning candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this was read, a troubled look passed over all; the guests
shook their heads and assured their host that it meant ill to him. And
each began to make excuses, saying that one and another engagement of
importance called them hence. The host laughed and bade them be seated,
while he ordered attendants to take the intruder and cast him into
prison for his impudence. They came to do so, but the Ussa took out his
official seal, giving the preconcerted signal meanwhile, which summoned
his ready followers. At sight of the King&rsquo;s seal terror blanched
the faces of each of the half-drunken men. The wicked host tried to
crawl under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>the house and escape, but he was at once caught
and bound with chains. One of the guests in fleeing through an
attic-way caught his <span class="corr" id="xd25e1416" title=
"Source: top-not">topknot</span> of hair in a rat-hole, and stood for
some time yelling for mercy, supposing that his captors had him. It was
as though an earthquake had shaken the house; all was the wildest
confusion.</p>
<p>The Ussa put on decent clothes and gave his orders in a calm manner.
He sent the Magistrate to the capital at once, and began to look
further into the affairs of the office. Soon, however, he sent a chair
for Chun Yang Ye, delegating his own servants, and commanding them not
to explain what had happened. She supposed that the Magistrate, full of
wine, had sent for her, intending to kill her, and she begged the
amused servants to call her Toh Ryung to come and stay with her. They
assured her that he could not come, as already he too was at the yamen,
and she feared that harm had befallen him on her account.</p>
<p>They removed her shackles and bore her to the yamen, where the Ussa
addressed her in a changed voice, commanding her to look up and answer
her charges. She refused to look up or speak, feeling that the sooner
death came the better. Failing in this way, he then asked her in his
own voice to just glance at him. Surprised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>she
looked up, and her dazed eyes saw her lover standing there in his
proper guise, and with a delighted cry she tried to run to him, but
fainted in the attempt, and was borne in his arms to a room. Just then
the old woman, coming along with food, which she had brought as a last
service to her daughter, heard the good news from the excited throng
outside, and dashing away her dishes and their contents, she tore
around for joy, crying: &ldquo;What a delightful birthday surprise for
a cruel magistrate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the people rejoiced with the daughter, but no one seemed to
think the old mother deserved such good fortune. The Ussa&rsquo;s
conduct was approved at court. A new magistrate was appointed. The
marriage was publicly solemnized at Seoul, and the Ussa was raised to a
high position, in which he was just to the people, who loved him for
his virtues, while the country rang with the praises of his faithful
wife, who became the mother of many children. <span class=

<h2 class="main">SIM CHUNG,</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE DUTIFUL DAUGHTER.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sim Hyun, or Mr. Sim, was highly esteemed in the
Korean village in which he resided. He belonged to the <i>Yang Ban</i>,
or gentleman class, and when he walked forth it was with the stately
swinging stride of the gentleman, while if he bestrode his favorite
donkey, or was carried in his chair, a runner went ahead calling out to
the commoners to clear the road. His rank was not high, and though
greatly esteemed as a scholar, his income would scarcely allow of his
taking the position he was fitted to occupy.</p>
<p>His parents had been very fortunate in betrothing him to a
remarkably beautiful and accomplished maiden, daughter of a neighboring
gentleman. She was noted for beauty and grace, while her mental
qualities were the subject of continual admiration. She could not only
read and write her native <i>ernmun</i>, but was skilled in Chinese
characters, while her embroidered shoes, pockets, and other feminine
articles were the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"
name="pb153">153</a>]</span>pride of her mother and friends. She had
embroidered a set of historic panels, which her father sent to the
King. His Majesty mentioned her skill with marked commendation, and had
the panels made up into a screen which for some time stood behind his
mat, and continually called forth his admiration.</p>
<p>Sim had not seemed very demonstrative in regard to his approaching
nuptials, but once he laid his eyes upon his betrothed, as she unveiled
at the ceremony, he was completely captivated, and brooked with poor
grace the formalities that had to be gone through before he could claim
her as his constant companion.</p>
<p>It was an exceptionally happy union, the pair being intellectually
suited to each other, and each apparently possessing the bodily
attributes necessary to charm the other. There was never a sign of
disgust or disappointment at the choice their parents had made for
them. They used to wander out into the little garden off the
women&rsquo;s quarters, and sit in the moonlight, planning for the
future, and enjoying the products of each other&rsquo;s well stored
mind. It was their pet desire to have a son, and all their plans seemed
to centre around this one ambition; the years came and went, however,
but their coveted blessing was withheld, the wife consulted
priestesses, and the husband, from long <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>and great
disappointment, grew sad at heart and cared but little for mingling
with the world, which he thought regarded him with shame. He took to
books and began to confine himself to his own apartments, letting his
poor wife stay neglected and alone in the apartments of the women. From
much study, lack of exercise, and failing appetite, he grew thin and
emaciated, and his eyes began to show the wear of over-work and
innutrition. The effect upon his wife was also bad, but, with a
woman&rsquo;s fortitude and patience, she bore up and hoped in spite of
constant disappointment. She worried over her husband&rsquo;s condition
and felt ashamed that she had no name in the world, other than the wife
of Sim, while she wished to be known as the mother of the Sim of whom
they had both dreamed by day and by night till dreams had almost left
them.</p>
<p>After fifteen years of childless waiting, the wife of Sim dreamed
again; this time her vision was a brilliant one, and in it she saw a
star come down to her from the skies above; the dream awakened her, and
she sent for her husband to tell him that she knew their blessing was
about to come to them; she was right, a child was given to them, but,
to their great dismay, it was only a girl. Heaven had kindly prepared
the way for the little visitor, however; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>for after fifteen
years weary waiting, they were not going to look with serious disfavor
upon a girl, however much their hopes had been placed upon the advent
of a son.</p>
<p>The child grew, and the parents were united as they only could be by
such a precious bond. The ills of childhood seemed not to like the
little one, even the virus of small-pox, that was duly placed in her
nostril, failed to innoculate her, and her pretty skin remained fresh
and soft like velvet, and totally free from the marks of the dread
disease.</p>
<p>At three years of age she bade fair to far surpass her
mother&rsquo;s noted beauty and accomplishments. Her cheeks were
full-blown roses, and whenever she opened her dainty curved mouth,
ripples of silvery laughter, or words of mature wisdom, were sure to be
given forth. The hearts of the parents, that had previously been full
of tears, were now light, and full of contentment and joy; while they
were constantly filled with pride by the reports of the wonderful
wisdom of their child that continually came to them. The father forgot
that his offspring was not a boy, and had his child continually by his
side to guide his footsteps, as his feeble eyes refused to perform
their office.</p>
<p>Just as their joy seemed too great to be lasting, it was suddenly
checked by the death of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>the mother, which plunged them
into a deep grief from which the father emerged totally blind. It soon
became a question as to where the daily food was to come from; little
by little household trinkets were given to the brokers to dispose of,
and in ten years they had used up the homestead, and all it
contained.</p>
<p>The father was now compelled to ask alms, and as his daughter was
grown to womanhood, she could no longer direct his footsteps as he
wandered out in the darkness of the blind.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1466src" href="#xd25e1466" name="xd25e1466src">1</a> One day in
his journeying he fell into a deep ditch, from which he could not
extricate himself. After remaining in this deplorable condition for
some time he heard a step, and called out for assistance, saying:
&ldquo;I am blind, not drunk,&rdquo; whereupon the passing stranger
said: &ldquo;I know full well you are not drunk. True, you are blind,
yet not incurably so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, who are you that you know so much about me?&rdquo; asked
the blind man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the old priest of the temple in the mountain
fortress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is this that you say about my not being
permanently blind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a prophet, and I have had a vision concerning you. In
case you make an offering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>of three hundred bags of rice to
the Buddha of our temple, you will be restored to sight, you will be
given rank and dignity, while your daughter will become the first woman
in all Korea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am poor, as well as blind,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;How can I promise such a princely offering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may give me your order for it, and pay it along as you
are able,&rdquo; said the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, give me pencil and paper,&rdquo; whereupon they
retired to a house, and the blind man gave his order for the costly
price of his sight. Returning home weary, bruised, and hungry, he
smiled to himself, in spite of his ill condition, at the thought of his
giving an order for so much rice when he had not a grain of it to
eat.</p>
<p>He obtained, finally, a little work in pounding rice in the stone
mortars. It was hard labor for one who had lived as he had done; but it
kept them from starving, and his daughter prepared his food for him as
nicely as she knew how. One night, as the dinner was spread on the
little, low table before him, sitting on the floor, the priest came and
demanded his pay; the old blind man lost his appetite for his dinner,
and refused to eat. He had to explain to his daughter the compact he
had made with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158"
name="pb158">158</a>]</span>priest, and, while she was filled with
grief, and dismayed at the enormity of the price, she yet seemed to
have some hope that it might be accomplished and his sight
restored.</p>
<p>That night, after her midnight bath, she lay down on a mat in the
open air, and gazed up to heaven, to which she prayed that her poor
father might be restored to health and sight. While thus engaged, she
fell asleep and dreamed that her mother came down from heaven to
comfort her, and told her not to worry, that a means would be found for
the payment of the rice, and that soon all would be happy again in the
little family.</p>
<p>The next day she chanced to hear of the wants of a great merchant
who sailed in his large boats to China for trade, but was greatly
distressed by an evil spirit that lived in the water through which he
must pass. For some time, it was stated, he had not been able to take
his boats over this dangerous place, and his loss therefrom was very
great. At last it was reported that he was willing and anxious to
appease the spirit by making the offering the wise men had deemed
necessary. Priests had told him that the sacrifice of a young maiden to
the spirit would quiet it and remove the trouble. He was, therefore,
anxious to find the proper person, and had offered a great sum to
obtain such an one. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"
name="pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sim Chung (our heroine), hearing of this, decided that it must be
the fulfilment of her dream, and having determined to go and offer
herself, she put on old clothes and fasted while journeying, that she
might look wan and haggard, like one in mourning. She had previously
prepared food for her father, and explained to him that she wished to
go and bow at her mother&rsquo;s grave, in return to her for having
appeared to her in a dream.</p>
<p>When the merchant saw the applicant, he was at once struck with her
beauty and dignity of carriage, in spite of her attempt to disguise
herself. He said that it was not in his heart to kill people especially
maidens of such worth as she seemed to be. He advised her not to apply;
but she told her story and said she would give herself for the three
hundred bags of rice. &ldquo;Ah! now I see the true nobility of your
character. I did not know that such filial piety existed outside the
works of the ancients. I will send to my master and secure the
rice,&rdquo; said the man, who happened to be but an overseer for a
greater merchant.</p>
<p>She got the rice and took it to the priest in a long procession of
one hundred and fifty ponies, each laboring under two heavy bags; the
debt cancelled and her doom fixed, she felt the relaxation and grief
necessarily consequent upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>such a condition. She could not
explain to her father, she mourned over the loneliness that would come
to him after she was gone, and wondered how he would support himself
after she was removed and until his sight should be restored. She lay
down and prayed to heaven, saying: &ldquo;I am only fourteen years old,
and have but four more hours to live. What will become of my poor
father? Oh! who will care for him? Kind heaven, protect him when I am
gone.&rdquo; Wild with grief she went and sat on her father&rsquo;s
knee, but could not control her sobs and tears; whereupon he asked her
what the trouble could be. Having made up her mind that the time had
come, and that the deed was done and could not be remedied, she decided
to tell him, and tried to break it gently; but when the whole truth
dawned upon the poor old man it nearly killed him. He clasped her close
to his bosom, and crying: &ldquo;My child, my daughter, my only
comfort, I will not let you go. What will eyes be to me if I can no
longer look upon your lovely face?&rdquo; They mingled their tears and
sobs, and the neighbors, hearing the commotion in the usually quiet
hut, came to see what was the trouble. Upon ascertaining the reason of
the old man&rsquo;s grief, they united in the general wailing. Sim
Chung begged them to come and care for the old man when she could look
after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>him no more, and they agreed to do so. While the
wailing and heart breaking was going on, a stranger rode up on a donkey
and asked for the Sim family. He came just in time to see what the act
was costing the poor people. He comforted the girl by giving her a
cheque for fifty bags of rice for the support of the father when his
daughter should be no more. She took it gratefully and gave it to the
neighbors to keep in trust; she then prepared herself, took a last
farewell, and left her fainting father to go to her bed in the sea.</p>
<p>In due time the boat that bore Sim Chung, at the head of a
procession of boats, arrived at the place where the evil spirit
reigned. She was dressed in bridal garments furnished by the merchant.
On her arrival at the place, the kind merchant tried once more to
appease the spirit by an offering of eatables, but it was useless,
whereupon Sim Chung prayed to heaven, bade them all good-by, and leaped
into the sea. Above, all was quiet, the waves subsided, the sea became
like a lake, and the boats passed on their way unmolested.</p>
<p>When Sim Chung regained her consciousness she was seated in a little
boat drawn by fishes, and pretty maidens were giving her to drink from
a carved jade bottle. She asked them who they were, and where she was
going. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>answered: &ldquo;We are servants of the King of
the Sea, and we are taking you to his palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim Chung wondered if this was death, and thought it very pleasant
if it were. They passed through forests of waving plants, and saw great
lazy fish feeding about in the water, till at last they reached the
confines of the palace. Her amazement was then unbounded, for the
massive walls were composed of precious stones, such as she had only
heretofore seen used as ornaments. Pearls were used to cover the heads
of nails in the great doors through which they passed, and everywhere
there seemed a most costly and lavish display of the precious gems and
metals, while the walks were made of polished black marble that shone
in the water. The light, as it passed through the water, seemed to form
most beautifully colored clouds, and the rainbow colors were everywhere
disporting themselves.</p>
<p>Soon a mighty noise was heard, and they moved aside, while the King
passed by preceded by an army with gayly colored and beautifully
embroidered satin banners, each bearer blowing on an enormous shell.
The King was borne in a golden chair on the shoulders of one hundred
men, followed by one hundred musicians and as many more beautiful
&ldquo;dancing girls,&rdquo; with wonderful head-dresses and rich
costumes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sim Chung objected to going before such an august king, but she was
assured of kind treatment, and, after being properly dressed by the sea
maids, in garments suitable for the palace of the Sea King, she was
borne in a chair on the shoulders of eunuchs to the King&rsquo;s
apartments. The King treated her with great respect, and all the
maidens and eunuchs bowed before her. She protested that she was not
worthy of such attention. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but the
daughter of a beggar, for whom I thought I was giving my life when
rescued by these maidens. I am in no way worthy of your
respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King smiled a little, and said: <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e1521" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Ah! I know more of you
than you know of yourself. You must know that I am the Sea King, and
that we know full well the doings of the stars which shine in the
heaven above, for they continually visit us on light evenings. Well,
you were once a star. Many say a beautiful one, for you had many
admirers. You favored one star more than the others, and, in your
attentions to him, you abused your office as cup-bearer to the King of
Heaven, and let your lover have free access to all of the choice wines
of the palace. In this way, before you were aware of it, the peculiar
and choice brands that the King especially liked were consumed, and,
upon examination, your fault became known. As punishment, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>the
King decided to banish you to earth, but fearing to send you both at
once, lest you might be drawn together there, he sent your lover first,
and after keeping you in prison for a long time, you were sent as
daughter to your former lover. He is the man you claim as father.
Heaven has seen your filial piety, however, and repents. You will be
hereafter most highly favored, as a reward for your dutiful
conduct.<span class="corr" id="xd25e1526" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> He then sent her to fine apartments
prepared for her, where she was to rest and recuperate before going
back to earth.</p>
<p>After a due period of waiting and feasting on royal food, Sim
Chung&rsquo;s beauty was more than restored. She had developed into a
complete woman, and her beauty was dazzling; her cheeks seemed colored
by the beautiful tints of the waters through which she moved with ease
and comfort, while her mind blossomed forth like a flower in the rare
society of the Sea King and his peculiarly gifted people.</p>
<p>When the proper time arrived for her departure for the world she had
left, a large and beautiful flower was brought into her chamber. It was
so arranged that Sim Chung could conceal herself inside of it, while
the delicious perfume and the juice of the plant were ample
nourishment. When she had bidden good-by to her peculiar friends and
taken her place inside <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>the flower, it was conveyed to the
surface of the sea, at the place where she had plunged in. She had not
waited long in this strange position before a boat bore in sight. It
proved to be the vessel of her friend the merchant. As he drew near his
old place of danger he marvelled much at sight of such a beautiful
plant, growing and blossoming in such a strange place, where once only
evil was to be expected. He was also well-nigh intoxicated by the
powerful perfume exhaled from the plant. Steering close he managed to
secure the flower and place it safely in his boat, congratulating
himself on securing so valuable and curious a present for his King. For
he decided at once to present it at the palace if he could succeed in
getting it safely there.</p>
<p>The plan succeeded, the strange plant with its stranger tenant was
duly presented to His Majesty, who was delighted with the gift, and
spent his time gazing upon it to the exclusion of state business. He
had a glass house prepared for it in an inner court, and seemed never
to tire of watching his new treasure.</p>
<p>At night, when all was quiet, Sim Chung was wont to come forth and
rest herself by walking in the moonlight. But, on one occasion, the
King, being indisposed and restless, thought he would go to breathe the
rich perfume of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166"
name="pb166">166</a>]</span>strange flower and rest himself. In this
way he chanced to see Sim Chung before she could conceal herself, and,
of course, his surprise was unbounded. He accosted her, not without
fear, demanding who she might be. She, being also afraid, took refuge
in her flower, when, to the amazement of both, the flower vanished,
leaving her standing alone where it had been but a moment before. The
King was about to flee, at this point, but she called to him not to
fear, that she was but a human being, and no spirit as he doubtless
supposed. The King drew near, and was at once lost in admiration of her
matchless beauty, when a great noise was heard outside, and eunuchs
came, stating that all the generals with the heads of departments were
asking for an audience on very important business. His Majesty very
reluctantly went to see what it all meant. An officer versed in
astronomy stated that they had, on the previous night, observed a
brilliant star descend from heaven and alight upon the palace, and that
they believed it boded good to the royal family. Then the King told of
the flower, and the wonderful apparition he had seen in the divine
maiden. It so happened that the queen was deceased, and it was soon
decided that the King should take this remarkable maiden for his wife.
The marriage was announced, and preparations all made. As the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>lady was without parents, supposably, the
ceremony took place at the royal wedding hall, and was an occasion of
great state.</p>
<p>Never was man more charmed by woman than in this case. The King
would not leave her by day or night, and the business of state was
almost totally neglected. At last Sim Chung chided her husband, telling
him it was not manly for the King to spend all his time in the
women&rsquo;s quarters; that if he cared so little for the rule as to
neglect it altogether, others might find occasion to usurp his place.
She enjoined upon him the necessity of giving the days to his business,
and being content to spend the nights with her. He saw her wisdom, and
remarked upon it, promising to abide by her advice.</p>
<p>After some time spent in such luxury, Sim Chung became lonely and
mourned for her poor father, but despaired of being able to see him.
She knew not if he were alive or dead, and the more she thought of it
the more she mourned, till tears were in her heart continually, and not
infrequently overflowed from her beautiful eyes. The King chanced to
see her weeping, and was solicitous to know the cause of her sorrow,
whereupon she answered that she was oppressed by a strange dream
concerning a poor blind man, and was desirous of alleviating in some
way the sufferings of the many blind men in the country. Again the King
marvelled at her great heart, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168"
href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>and offered to do any thing
towards carrying out her noble purpose. Together they agreed that they
would summon all the blind men of the country to a great feast, at
which they should be properly clothed, amply fed, and treated each to a
present of cash.</p>
<p>The edict was issued, and on the day appointed for the feast, the
Queen secreted herself in a pavilion, from which she could look down
and fully observe the strange assemblage. She watched the first day,
but saw no one who resembled her lost parent; again the second day she
held her earnest vigil, but in vain. She was about to give up her quest
as useless and mourn over the loss of her father, when, as the feast
was closing on the third day, a feeble old man in rags came tottering
up. The attendants, having served so many, were treating this poor
fellow with neglect, and were about to drive him away as too late when
the Queen ordered them whipped and the old man properly fed.</p>
<p>He seemed well-nigh starved, and grasped at the food set before him
with the eagerness of an animal. There seemed to be something about
this forlorn creature that arrested and engaged the attention of the
Queen, and the attendants, noticing this, were careful to clothe him
with extra care. When sufficient time had elapsed for the satisfying of
his hunger, he was ordered brought to the Queen&rsquo;s pavilion, where
Her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>Majesty scrutinized him closely for a few
moments, and then, to the surprise and dismay of all her attendants,
she screamed: &ldquo;My father! my father!&rdquo; and fell at his feet
senseless. Her maids hurried off to tell the King of the strange
conduct of their mistress, and he came to see for himself. By rubbing
her limbs and applying strong-smelling medicines to her nostrils, the
fainting Queen was restored to consciousness, and allowed to tell her
peculiar and interesting story. The King had heard much of it
previously. But the poor old blind man could barely collect his senses
sufficiently to grasp the situation. As the full truth began to dawn
upon him, he cried: &ldquo;Oh! my child, can the dead come back to us?
I hear your voice; I feel your form; but how can I know it is you, for
I have no eyes? Away with these sightless orbs!&rdquo; And he tore at
his eyes with his nails, when to his utter amazement and joy, the
scales fell away, and he stood rejoicing in his sight once more.</p>
<p>His Majesty was overjoyed to have his lovely Queen restored to her
wonted happy frame of mind. He made the old man an officer of high
rank, appointed him a fine house, and had him married to the
accomplished daughter of an officer of suitable rank, thereby
fulfilling the last of the prophecy of both the aged priest and the
King of the Sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"

<h2 class="main">HONG KIL TONG;</h2>
<h2 class="main">OR, THE ADVENTURES OF AN ABUSED BOY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the reign of the third king in Korea there
lived a noble of high rank and noted family, by name Hong. His title
was Ye Cho Pansa. He had two sons by his wife and one by one of his
concubines. The latter son was very remarkable from his birth to his
death, and he it is who forms the subject of this history.</p>
<p>When Hong Pansa was the father of but two sons, he dreamed by night
on one occasion that he heard the noise of thunder, and looking up he
saw a huge dragon entering his apartment, which seemed too small to
contain the whole of his enormous body. The dream was so startling as
to awaken the sleeper, who at once saw that it was a good omen, and a
token to him of a blessing about to be conferred. He hoped the blessing
might prove to be another son, and went to impart the good news to his
wife. She would not see him, however, as she was offended by his taking
a concubine from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171"
name="pb171">171</a>]</span>the class of &ldquo;dancing girls.&rdquo;
The great man was sad, and went away. Within the year, however, a son
of marvellous beauty was born to one concubine, much to the annoyance
of his wife and to himself, for he would have been glad to have the
beautiful boy a full son, and eligible to office. The child was named
Kil Tong, or Hong Kil Tong. He grew fast, and became more and more
beautiful. He learned rapidly, and surprised every one by his
remarkable ability. As he grew up he rebelled at being placed with the
slaves, and at not being allowed to call his parent, father. The other
children laughed and jeered at him, and made life very miserable. He
refused longer to study of the duties of children to their parents. He
upset his table in school, and declared he was going to be a soldier.
One bright moonlight night Hong Pansa saw his son in the court-yard
practising the arts of the soldier, and he asked him what it meant. Kil
Tong answered that he was fitting himself to become a man that people
should respect and fear. He said he knew that heaven had made all
things for the use of men, if they found themselves capable of using
them, and that the laws of men were only made to assist a few that
could not otherwise do as they would; but that he was not inclined to
submit to any such tyranny, but would become a great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>man
in spite of his evil surroundings. &ldquo;This is a most remarkable
boy,&rdquo; mused Hong Pansa. &ldquo;What a pity that he is not my
proper and legitimate son, that he might be an honor to my name. As it
is, I fear he will cause me serious trouble.&rdquo; He urged the boy to
go to bed and sleep, but Kil Tong said it was useless, that if he went
to bed he would think of his troubles till the tears washed sleep away
from his eyes, and caused him to get up.</p>
<p>The wife of Hong Pansa and his other concubine (the dancing girl),
seeing how much their lord and master thought of Kil Tong, grew to hate
the latter intensely, and began to lay plans for ridding themselves of
him. They called some <i>mootang</i>, or sorceresses, and explained to
them that their happiness was disturbed by this son of a rival, and
that peace could only be restored to their hearts by the death of this
youth. The witches laughed and said: &ldquo;Never mind. There is an old
woman who lives by the east gate, tell her to come and prejudice the
father. She can do it, and he will then look after his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old hag came as requested. Hong Pansa was then in the
women&rsquo;s apartments, telling them of the wonderful boy, much to
their annoyance. A visitor was announced, and the old woman made a low
bow outside. Hong Pansa <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href=
"#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>asked her what her business was,
and she stated that she had heard of his wonderful son, and came to see
him, to foretell what his future was to be.</p>
<p>Kil Tong came as called, and on seeing him the hag bowed and said:
&ldquo;Send out all of the people.&rdquo; She then stated: &ldquo;This
will be a very great man; if not a king, he will be greater than the
king, and will avenge his early wrongs by killing all his
family.&rdquo; At this the father called to her to stop, and enjoined
strict secrecy upon her. He sent Kil Tong at once to a strong room, and
had him locked in for safe keeping.</p>
<p>The boy was very sad at this new state of affairs, but as his father
let him have books, he got down to hard study, and learned the Chinese
works on astronomy. He could not see his mother, and his unnatural
father was too afraid to come near him. He made up his mind, however,
that as soon as he could get out he would go to some far off country,
where he was not known, and make his true power felt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unnatural father was kept in a state of continual
excitement by his wicked concubine, who was bent on the destruction of
the son of her rival, and kept constantly before her master the great
dangers that would come to him from being the parent of such a man as
Kil Tong was destined to be, if allowed to live. She showed him that
such power as the boy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>was destined to possess, would
eventually result in his overthrowal, and with him his father&rsquo;s
house would be in disgrace, and, doubtless, would be abolished. While
if this did not happen, the son was sure to kill his family, so that,
in either case, it was the father&rsquo;s clear duty to prevent any
further trouble by putting the boy out of the way. Hong Pansa was
finally persuaded that his concubine was right, and sent for the
assassins to come and kill his son. But a spirit filled the father with
disease, and he told the men to stay their work. Medicines failed to
cure the disease, and the <i>mootang</i> women were called in by the
concubine. They beat their drums and danced about the room, conjuring
the spirit to leave, but it would not obey. At last they said, at the
suggestion of the concubine, that Kil Tong was the cause of the
disorder, and that with his death the spirit would cease troubling the
father.</p>
<p>Again the assassins were sent for, and came with their swords,
accompanied by the old hag from the east gate. While they were
meditating on the death of Kil Tong, he was musing on the unjust laws
of men who allowed sons to be born of concubines, but denied them
rights that were enjoyed by other men.</p>
<p>While thus musing in the darkness of the night, he heard a crow caw
three times and fly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175"
name="pb175">175</a>]</span>away. &ldquo;This means something ill to
me,&rdquo; thought he; and just then his window was thrown open, and in
stepped the assassins. They made at the boy, but he was not there. In
their rage they wounded each other, and killed the old woman who was
their guide. To their amazement the room had disappeared, and they were
surrounded by high mountains. A mighty storm arose, and rocks flew
through the air. They could not escape, and, in their terror, were
about to give up, when music was heard, and a boy came riding by on a
donkey, playing a flute. He took away their weapons, and showed himself
to be Kil Tong. He promised not to kill them, as they begged for their
lives, but only on condition that they should never try to kill another
man. He told them that he would know if the promise was broken, and, in
that event, he would instantly kill them.</p>
<p>Kil Tong went by night to see his father, who thought him a spirit,
and was very much afraid. He gave his father medicine, which instantly
cured him; and sending for his mother, bade her good-by, and started
for an unknown country.</p>
<p>His father was very glad that the boy had escaped, and lost his
affection for his wicked concubine. But the latter, with her mistress,
was very angry, and tried in vain to devise some means to accomplish
their evil purposes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176"
name="pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kil Tong, free at last, journeyed to the south, and began to ascend
the lonely mountains. Tigers were abundant, but he feared them not, and
they seemed to avoid molesting him. After many days, he found himself
high up on a barren peak enveloped by the clouds, and enjoyed the
remoteness of the place, and the absence of men and obnoxious laws. He
now felt himself a free man, and the equal of any, while he knew that
heaven was smiling upon him and giving him powers not accorded to other
men.</p>
<p>Through the clouds at some distance he thought he espied a huge
stone door in the bare wall of rock. Going up to it, he found it to be
indeed a movable door, and, opening it, he stepped inside, when, to his
amazement, he found himself in an open plain, surrounded by high and
inaccessible mountains. He saw before him over two hundred good houses,
and many men, who, when they had somewhat recovered from their own
surprise, came rushing upon him, apparently with evil intent. Laying
hold upon him they asked him who he was, and why he came trespassing
upon their ground. He said: &ldquo;I am surprised to find myself in the
presence of men. I am but the son of a concubine, and men, with their
laws, are obnoxious to me. Therefore, I thought to get away from man
entirely, and, for that reason, I wandered alone <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>into
these wild regions. But who are you, and why do you live in this lone
spot? Perhaps we may have a kindred feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are called thieves,&rdquo; was answered; &ldquo;but we
only despoil the hated official class of some of their ill-gotten
gains. We are willing to help the poor unbeknown, but no man can enter
our stronghold and depart alive, unless he has become one of us. To do
so, however, he must prove himself to be strong in body and mind. If
you can pass the examination and wish to join our party, well and good;
otherwise you die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suited Kil Tong immensely, and he consented to the conditions.
They gave him various trials of strength, but he chose his own. Going
up to a huge rock on which several men were seated, he laid hold of it
and hurled it to some distance, to the dismay of the men, who fell from
their seat, and to the surprised delight of all. He was at once
installed a member, and a feast was ordered. The contract was sealed by
mingling blood from the lips of all the members with blood similarly
supplied by Kil Tong. He was then given a prominent seat and served to
wine and food.</p>
<p>Kil Tong soon became desirous of giving to his comrades some
manifestation of his courage. An opportunity presently offered. He
heard <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>the men bemoaning their inability to despoil a
large and strong Buddhist temple not far distant. As was the rule, this
temple in the mountains was well patronized by officials, who made it a
place of retirement for pleasure and debauch, and in return the lazy,
licentious priests were allowed to collect tribute from the poor people
about, till they had become rich and powerful. The several attempts
made by the robber band had proved unsuccessful, by virtue of the
number and vigilance of the priests, together with the strength of
their enclosure. Kil Tong agreed to assist them to accomplish their
design or perish in the attempt, and such was their faith in him that
they readily agreed to his plans.</p>
<p>On a given day Kil Tong, dressed in the red gown of a youth, just
betrothed, covered himself with the dust of travel, and mounted on a
donkey, with one robber disguised as a servant, made his way to the
temple. He asked on arrival to be shown to the head priest, to whom he
stated that he was the son of Hong Pansa, that his noble father having
heard of the greatness of this temple, and the wisdom of its many
priests, had decided to send him with a letter, which he produced, to
be educated among their numbers. He also stated that a train of one
hundred ponies loaded with rice had been sent as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>a
present from his father to the priest, and he expected they would
arrive before dark, as they did not wish to stop alone in the
mountains, even though every pony was attended by a groom, who was
armed for defense. The priests were delighted, and having read the
letter, they never for a moment suspected that all was not right. A
great feast was ordered in honor of their noble scholar, and all sat
down before the tables, which were filled so high that one could hardly
see his neighbor on the opposite side. They had scarcely seated
themselves and indulged in the generous wine, when it was announced
that the train of ponies laden with rice had arrived. Servants were
sent to look after the tribute, and the eating and drinking went on.
Suddenly Kil Tong clapped his hand, over his cheek with a cry of pain,
which drew the attention of all. When, to the great mortification of
the priests, he produced from his mouth a pebble, previously introduced
on the sly, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Is it to feed on stones that my
father sent me to this place? What do you mean by setting such rice
before a gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priests were filled with mortification and dismay, and bowed
their shaven heads to the floor in humiliation. When at a sign from Kil
Tong, a portion of the robbers, who had entered the court as grooms to
the ponies, seized the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href=
"#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>bending priests and bound them as
they were. The latter shouted for help, but the other robbers, who had
been concealed in the bags, which were supposed to contain rice, seized
the servants, while others were loading the ponies with jewels, rice,
cash and whatever of value they could lay hands upon.</p>
<p>An old priest who was attending to the fires, seeing the uproar,
made off quietly to the yamen near by and called for soldiers. The
soldiers were sent after some delay, and Kil Tong, disguised as a
priest, called to them to follow him down a by-path after the robbers.
While he conveyed the soldiers over this rough path, the robbers made
good their escape by the main road, and were soon joined in their
stronghold by their youthful leader, who had left the soldiers groping
helplessly in the dark among the rocks and trees in a direction
opposite that taken by the robbers.</p>
<p>The priests soon found out that they had lost almost all their
riches, and were at no loss in determining how the skilful affair had
been planned and carried out. Kil Tong&rsquo;s name was noised abroad,
and it was soon known that he was heading a band of robbers, who,
through his assistance, were able to do many marvellous things. The
robber band were delighted at the success of his first undertaking, and
made him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>their chief, with the consent of all. After
sufficient time had elapsed for the full enjoyment of their last and
greatest success, Kil Tong planned a new raid.</p>
<p>The Governor of a neighboring province was noted for his overbearing
ways and the heavy burdens that he laid upon his subjects. He was very
rich, but universally hated, and Kil Tong decided to avenge the people
and humiliate the Governor, knowing that his work would be appreciated
by the people, as were indeed his acts at the temple. He instructed his
band to proceed singly to the Governor&rsquo;s city&mdash;the local
capital&mdash;at the time of a fair, when their coming would not cause
comment. At a given time a portion of them were to set fire to a lot of
straw-thatched huts outside the city gates, while the others repaired
in a body to the Governor&rsquo;s yamen. They did so. The Governor was
borne in his chair to a place where he could witness the conflagration,
which also drew away the most of the inhabitants. The robbers bound the
remaining servants, and while some were securing money, jewels, and
weapons, Kil Tong wrote on the walls: &ldquo;The wicked Governor that
robs the people is relieved of his ill-gotten gains by Kil
Tong&mdash;the people&rsquo;s avenger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the thieves made good their escape, and Kil Tong&rsquo;s name
became known everywhere. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href=
"#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>The Governor offered a great
reward for his capture, but no one seemed desirous of encountering a
robber of such boldness. At last the King offered a reward after
consulting with his officers. When one of them said he would capture
the thief alone, the King was astonished at his boldness and courage,
and bade him be off and make the attempt. The officer was called the
Pochang; he had charge of the prisons, and was a man of great
courage.</p>
<p>The Pochang started on his search, disguised as a traveller. He took
a donkey and servant, and after travelling many days he put up at a
little inn, at the same time that another man on a donkey rode up. The
latter was Kil Tong in disguise, and he soon entered into conversation
with the man, whose mission was known to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I goo</i>,&rdquo; said Kil Tong, as he sat down to eat,
&ldquo;this is a dangerous country. I have just been chased by the
robber Kil Tong till the life is about gone out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kil Tong, did you say?&rdquo; remarked Pochang. &ldquo;I wish
he would chase me. I am anxious to see the man of whom we hear so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you see him once you will be satisfied,&rdquo;
replied Kil Tong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the Pochang. &ldquo;Is he such a
fearful-looking man as to frighten one by his aspect alone?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No; on the contrary he looks much as do ordinary mortals. But
we <i>know</i> he is different, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the Pochang. &ldquo;That is just the
trouble. You are afraid of him before you see him. Just let me get a
glimpse of him, and matters will be different, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Kil Tong, &ldquo;you can be easily pleased,
if that is all, for I dare say if you go back into the mountains here
you will see him, and get acquainted with him too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good. Will you show me the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I. I have seen enough of him to please me. I can tell you
where to go, however, if you persist in your curiosity,&rdquo; said the
robber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; exclaimed the officer. &ldquo;Let us be off at
once lest he escapes. And if you succeed in showing him to me, I will
reward you for your work and protect you from the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some objection by Kil Tong, who appeared to be reluctant to
go, and insisted on at least finishing his dinner, they started off,
with their servants, into the mountains. Night overtook them, much to
the apparent dismay of the guide, who pretended to be very anxious to
give up the quest. At length, however, they came to the stone door,
which was open. Having entered the robber&rsquo;s stronghold, the door
closed behind them, and the guide disappeared, leaving <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>the
dismayed officer surrounded by the thieves. His courage had now left
him, and he regretted his rashness. The robbers bound him securely and
led him past their miniature city into an enclosure surrounded by
houses which, by their bright colors, seemed to be the abode of
royalty. He was conveyed into a large audience-chamber occupying the
most extensive building of the collection, and there, on a sort of
throne, in royal style, sat his guide. The Pochang saw his mistake, and
fell on his face, begging for mercy. Kil Tong upbraided him for his
impudence and arrogance and promised to let him off this time. Wine was
brought, and all partook of it. That given to the officer was drugged,
and he fell into a stupor soon after drinking it. While in this
condition he was put into a bag and conveyed in a marvellous manner to
a high mountain overlooking the capital. Here he found himself upon
recovering from the effects of his potion; and not daring to face his
sovereign with such a fabulous tale, he cast himself down from the high
mountain, and was picked up dead, by passers-by, in the morning. Almost
at the same time that His Majesty received word of the death of his
officer, and was marvelling at the audacity of the murderer in bringing
the body almost to the palace doors, came simultaneous reports of great
depredations in each of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>the eight provinces. The trouble
was in each case attributed to Kil Tong, and the fact that he was
reported as being in eight far removed places at the same time caused
great consternation.</p>
<p>Official orders were issued to each of the eight governors to catch
and bring to the city, at once, the robber Kil Tong. These orders were
so well obeyed that upon a certain day soon after, a guard came from
each province bringing Kil Tong, and there in a line stood eight men
alike in every respect.</p>
<p>The King on inquiry found that Kil Tong was the son of Hong Pansa,
and the father was ordered into the royal presence. He came with his
legitimate son, and bowed his head in shame to the ground. When asked
what he meant by having a son who would cause such general misery and
distress, he swooned away, and would have died had not one of the Kil
Tongs produced some medicine which cured him. The son, however, acted
as spokesman, and informed the King that Kil Tong was but the son of
his father&rsquo;s slave, that he was utterly incorrigible, and had
fled from home when a mere boy. When asked to decide as to which was
his true son, the father stated that his son had a scar on the left
thigh. Instantly each of the eight men pulled up the baggy trousers and
displayed a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>scar. The guard was commanded to remove the men
and kill all of them; but when they attempted to do so the life had
disappeared, and the men were found to be only figures in straw and
wax.</p>
<p>Soon after this a letter was seen posted on the Palace gate,
announcing that if the government would confer upon Kil Tong the rank
of Pansa, as held by his father, and thus remove from him the stigma
attaching to him as the son of a slave, he would stop his depredations.
This proposition could not be entertained at first, but one of the
counsel suggested that it might offer a solution of the vexed question,
and they could yet be spared the disgrace of having an officer with
such a record. For, as he proposed, men could be so stationed that when
the newly-appointed officer came to make his bow before His Majesty,
they could fall upon him and kill him before he arose. This plan was
greeted with applause, and a decree was issued conferring the desired
rank; proclamations to that effect being posted in public places, so
that the news would reach Kil Tong. It did reach him, and he soon
appeared at the city gate. A great crowd attended him as he rode to the
Palace gates; but knowing the plans laid for him, as he passed through
the gates and came near enough to be seen of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>King, he was caught up in a cloud and borne away
amid strange music; wholly discomfiting his enemies.</p>
<p>Some time after this occurrence the King was walking with a few
eunuchs and attendants in the royal gardens. It was evening time, but
the full moon furnished ample light. The atmosphere was tempered just
to suit; it was neither cold nor warm, while it lacked nothing of the
bracing character of a Korean autumn. The leaves were blood-red on the
maples; the heavy cloak of climbing vines that enshrouded the great
wall near by was also beautifully colored. These effects could even be
seen by the bright moonlight, and seated on a hill-side the royal party
were enjoying the tranquillity of the scene, when all were astonished
by the sound of a flute played by some one up above them. Looking up
among the tree-tops a man was seen descending toward them, seated upon
the back of a gracefully moving stork. The King imagined it must be
some heavenly being, and ordered the chief eunuch to make some proper
salutation. But before this could be done, a voice was heard saying:
&ldquo;Fear not, O King. I am simply Hong Pansa [Kil Tong&rsquo;s new
title]. I have come to make my obeisance before your august presence
and be confirmed in my rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he did, and no one attempted to molest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>him;
seeing which, the King, feeling that it was useless longer to attempt
to destroy a man who could read the unspoken thoughts of men, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you persist in troubling the country? I have removed
from you now the stigma attached to your birth. What more will you
have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Kil Tong, with due humility, &ldquo;to go
to a distant land, and settle down to the pursuit of peace and
happiness. If I may be granted three thousand bags of rice I will
gladly go and trouble you no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will you transport such an enormous quantity of
rice?&rdquo; asked the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can be arranged,&rdquo; said Kil Tong. &ldquo;If I may
be but granted the order, I will remove the rice at
daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order was given. Kil Tong went away as he came, and in the early
morning a fleet of junks appeared off the royal granaries, took on the
rice, and made away before the people were well aware of their
presence.</p>
<p>Kil Tong now sailed for an island off the west coast. He found one
uninhabited, and with his few followers he stored his riches, and
brought many articles of value from his former hiding-places. His
people he taught to till the soil, and all went well on the little
island till <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>the master made a trip to a neighboring island,
which was famous for its deadly mineral poison,&mdash;a thing much
prized for tipping the arrows with. Kil Tong wanted to get some of this
poison, and made a visit to the island. While passing through the
settled districts he casually noticed that many copies of a
proclamation were posted up, offering a large reward to any one who
would succeed in restoring to her father a young lady who had been
stolen by a band of savage people who lived in the mountains.</p>
<p>Kil Tong journeyed on all day, and at night he found himself high up
in the wild mountain regions, where the poison was abundant. Gazing
about in making some preparations for passing the night in this place,
he saw a light, and following it, he came to a house built below him on
a ledge of rocks, and in an almost inaccessible position. He could see
the interior of a large hall, where were gathered many hairy,
shaggy-looking men, eating, drinking, and smoking. One old fellow, who
seemed to be chief, was tormenting a young lady by trying to tear away
her veil and expose her to the gaze of the barbarians assembled. Kil
Tong could not stand this sight, and, taking a poisoned arrow, he sent
it direct for the heart of the villain, but the distance was so great
that he missed his mark sufficiently to only wound the arm. All
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>were amazed, and in the confusion the girl
escaped, and Kil Tong concealed himself for the night. He was seen next
day by some of the savage band, who caught him, and demanded who he was
and why he was found in the mountains. He answered that he was a
physician, and had come up there to collect a certain rare medicine
only known to exist in those mountains.</p>
<p>The robbers seemed rejoiced, and explained that their chief had been
wounded by an arrow from the clouds, and asked him if he could cure
him. Kil Tong was taken in and allowed to examine the chief, when he
agreed to cure him within three days. Hastily mixing up some of the
fresh poison, he put it into the wound, and the chief died almost at
once. Great was the uproar when the death became known. All rushed at
the doctor, and would have killed him, but Kil Tong, finding his own
powers inadequate, summoned to his aid his old friends the spirits
(<i>quay sin</i>), and swords flashed in the air, striking off heads at
every blow, and not ceasing till the whole band lay weltering in their
own blood.</p>
<p>Bursting open a door, Kil Tong saw two women sitting with covered
faces, and supposing them to be of the same strange people, he was
about to dispatch them on the spot, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>one of them threw
aside her veil and implored for mercy. Then it was that Kil Tong
recognized the maiden whom he had rescued the previous evening. She was
marvellously beautiful, and already he was deeply smitten with her
maidenly charms. Her voice seemed like that of an angel of peace sent
to quiet the hearts of rough men. As she modestly begged for her life,
she told the story of her capture by the robbers, and how she had been
dragged away to their den, and was only saved from insult by the
interposition of some heavenly being, who had in pity smote the arm of
her tormentor.</p>
<p>Great was Kil Tong&rsquo;s joy at being able to explain his own part
in the matter, and the maiden heart, already won by the manly beauty of
her rescuer, now overflowed with gratitude and love. Remembering
herself, however, she quickly veiled her face, but the mischief had
been done; each had seen the other, and they could henceforth know no
peace, except in each other&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The proclamations had made but little impression upon Kil Tong, and
it was not till the lady had told her story that he remembered reading
them. He at once took steps to remove the beautiful girl and her
companion in distress, and not knowing but that other of the savages
might return, he did not dare to make search <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>for
a chair and bearers, but mounting donkeys the little party set out for
the home of the distressed parents, which they reached safely in due
time. The father&rsquo;s delight knew no bounds. He was a subject of
Korea&rsquo;s King, yet he possessed this island and ruled its people
in his own right. And calling his subjects, he explained to them
publicly the wonderful works of the stranger, to whom he betrothed his
daughter, and to whom he gave his official position.</p>
<p>The people indulged in all manner of gay festivities in honor of the
return of the lost daughter of their chief; in respect to the bravery
of Kil Tong; and to celebrate his advent as their ruler.</p>
<p>In due season the marriage ceremonies were celebrated, and the
impatient lovers were given to each other&rsquo;s embrace. Their lives
were full of happiness and prosperity. Other outlying islands were
united under Kil Tong&rsquo;s rule, and no desire or ambition remained
ungratified. Yet there came a time when the husband grew sad, and tears
swelled the heart of the young wife as she tried in vain to comfort
him. He explained at last that he had a presentiment that his father
was either dead or dying, and that it was his duty to go and mourn at
the grave. With anguish at the thought of parting, the wife urged him
to go. Taking a junk laden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=
"#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>with handsome marble slabs for the
grave and statuary to surround it, and followed by junks bearing three
thousand bags of rice, he set out for the capital. Arriving, he cut off
his hair, and repaired to his old home, where a servant admitted him on
the supposition that he was a priest. He found his father was no more;
but the body yet remained, because a suitable place could not be found
for the burial. Thinking him to be a priest, Kil Tong was allowed to
select the spot, and the burial took place with due ceremony. Then it
was that the son revealed himself, and took his place with the
mourners. The stone images and monuments were erected upon the nicely
sodded grounds. Kil Tong sent the rice he had brought, to the
government granaries in return for the King&rsquo;s loan to him, and
regretted that mourning would prevent his paying his respects to his
King; he set out for his home with his true mother and his
father&rsquo;s legal wife. The latter did not survive long after the
death of her husband, but the poor slave-mother of the bright boy was
spared many years to enjoy the peace and quiet of her son&rsquo;s
bright home, and to be ministered to by her dutiful, loving children
and their numerous offspring.</p>
